Among 4,081 vaccinated healthcare\nworkers in Israel, 22 (0.54%) developed COVID-19 from\n1–10 days (median 3.5 days) after immunization. Clini-\ncians should not dismiss postvaccination symptoms as\nvaccine-related and should promptly test for COVID-19.\nL\narge-scale vaccination of risk groups and later the\ngeneral population is the single most effective pub-\nlic health measure for mitigation of the coronavirus\ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic. National COVID-19\nvaccination programs started during December 2020\nin several countries and prioritized healthcare workers\n1 (HCWs) ( ). In some countries the vaccination programs\ncoincided with a surge in detected COVID-19 cases and\n2 increased burden on the healthcare system ( ).\nDuring December 2020–January 2021, Israel expe-\nrienced a surge in COVID-19 incidence that resulted\nin the third national lockdown imposed since the pan-\n3 demic began in early 2020 ( ). Concomitantly, during\nDecember 2020, Israel’s Ministry of Health approved\nthe Pfi zer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2;\nPfi zer Inc., https://www.pfi zer.com) and prioritized\n4 HCWs for immunization ( ).\nSheba Medical Center is a large hospital with\n9,069 staff members in Ramat-Gan, Israel. The hos-\npital started its personnel vaccination program on\nDecember 20, 2020, and excluded workers who had\nrecovered from COVID-19. During the fi rst week of\nthe campaign, 4,081 (45%) eligible staff members re-\nceived the fi rst dose of BNT162b2. Concurrently, the\nnational COVID-19 positivity rate rapidly increased\n2 to >6% on January 3, 2021 ( ).\nThe Study\nThe hospital’s Infection Prevention and Control Unit\nconducted active and passive surveillance of vaccinat-\ned staff by using daily health questionnaires, hotlines,\non-call infectious disease unit staff, and post-vacci-\nAuthors aﬃ  liation: Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2704.210016\n1220 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 27, No. 4, April 2021\n\nGili Regev-Yochay 1 1\nnation web-based questionnaires to identify and test\nsymptomatic HCWs. Among 4,081 HCWs vaccinated\nin the fi rst week of the campaign, 22 (0.54%) later had\nlaboratory-confi rmed COVID-19 (Table). The average\nage among COVID-19–positive vaccinated HCWs was\n45.3 years (±9.85 years), and they belonged to different\nhealthcare sectors and worked on various wards.\nAmong the 22 vaccinated HCWs who tested posi-\ntive for COVID-19, 13 were tested because they had\nsymptoms, most commonly an infl uenza-like illness\nthat included fever, chills, cough, headache, myalgia,\nand sore throat. Two vaccinated HCWs were tested\nbecause of exposure to confi rmed or suspected COV-\nID-19 cases yet reported symptoms upon questioning.\nAsymptomatic COVID-19 cases were identifi ed among\nHCWs as part of postexposure screening. Among the\n22 COVID-19–positive HCWs, 11 had presumable\ncommunity-related exposures, 4 of whom reported ex-\nposure incidents that occurred before or on the date of\nvaccination. An investigation conducted by the hospi-\ntal’s Infection Control and Prevention Unit identifi ed\n10 healthcare-related secondary exposures. However,\nwe did not identify any point-source exposures or CO-\nVID-19 clusters linked to the immunization process.\nAmong the 11 vaccinated HCWs who reported\nCOVID-19 symptoms, the median time between the\nfi rst dose of BNT162b2 immunization and symptom\nonset was 3.5 (range 0–10) days; we excluded 1 vaccin-\nee from our calculation and analysis because the HCW\nhad symptoms before immunization (Table). The me-\ndian time between the onset of symptoms and testing\nwas 1 day, demonstrating the high level of suspicion\nfor COVID-19 during the vaccination campaign.\nOf note, apart from the need for early detection,\npersons who test positive for COVID-19 after receiv-\ning the fi rst vaccine dose (whether asymptomatic\nand tested following exposure or tested because they\nare symptomatic) are not eligible to receive the sec-\nond dose, according to Ministry of Health policy.\nHowever, depending on availability of vaccines, this\npolicy might change when further data are collected.\nThese authors equally contributed to the study. 1\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 in HCWs is a major concern for health au-\nthorities worldwide. HCWs, especially acute and chron-\nic care facility personnel, are at high risk for contracting\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 and might\nbecome infected at home or nosocomially while caring\n5 for patients or interacting with other staff members ( –\n7 ). Infections among HCWs have an immediate effect\non their close occupational environment and the overall\nhealthcare system. Secondary exposures, isolation, and\ninfections of staff can substantially impair the capacity\nof a single ward to care for patients, creating a snowball\neffect with collateral damage to both the functional re-\nsilience of the facility and morale of staff. Consequently,\nas soon as COVID-19 vaccines were deployed in Israel,\nHCWs were the first group to receive it.\nWe report 22 cases of early, postimmunization,\nlaboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among HCWs dur-\ning the launch of the vaccination campaign in a large\nhospital in Israel.
