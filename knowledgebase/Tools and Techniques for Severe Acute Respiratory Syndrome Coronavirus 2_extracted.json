Ef cient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as rapid and large-scale\ntesting plays a pivotal role in patient management and decelerating disease spread. This\npaper reviews current technologies used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as\nwell as advances made for molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care\ntesting, including recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance\nof the timing and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as dis-\nease prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of the various\nmethodologies are presented, along with their application span and known performance\ncharacteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers are also covered, with an\nemphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or monitoring disease severity or complica-\ntions. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is rapidly evolving, this review highlights topics of\ninterest that have occurred during the pandemic and the lessons learned throughout.\nExploring a broad armamentarium of techniques for detecting SARS-CoV-2 will ensure\ncontinued diagnostic support for clinicians, public health, and infection prevention\nand control for this pandemic and provide advice for future pandemic preparedness.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, NAAT, PCR, serology, antigen, KEYWORDS\ncoronavirus, biomarkers, next-generation sequencing\nINTRODUCTION\nW ﬁ hile coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not the\ncentury (1), it has generated unprecedented global concern and responses.\nCOVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is\nthought to have emerged from a zoonotic source (2) and spread rapidly in humans\nthrough respiratory droplets and contact. There is some concern for airborne transmission,\nbut the role of this transmission route outside the potential aerosolizing procedures in\n– health care settings is unclear (3 5). With an estimated reproductive number,\n– of between 1.4 and 5.6, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread worldwide (6\n– reported in December 2019 (10 12), there have been over 106 million con\n2.3 million deaths reported worldwide (as of 9 February 2021) (13).\nFrom a disease manifestation perspective, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptom-\nﬂ atic (14), and COVID-19 spans from a mild in\ncomplications (15, 16). SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the respiratory tract, resulting in\npneumonia, but also can affect gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, or cardiovascular sys-\ntems. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 include cutaneous manifestations such as a\nKawasaki-like disease in children and ophthalmic/gustatory dysfunction (i.e., anosmia\nand ageusia, which are the loss of smell and taste, respectively), which may have been\n– underestimated in initial reports (17 20).\nDespite numerous therapeutic options being explored (e.g., convalescent-phase\nplasma), no large-scale treatments are available. Public health interventions have\nevolved over time to limit viral spread (Fig. 1) and have included the use of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) like masks, handwashing, and containment measures such\nas city lockdowns, travel restrictions, and physical distancing (21\n’ strategies have been essential to reduce the virus\nadverse socioeconomic impacts, and adherence to these prevention strategies is challeng-\ning to sustain (22). Currently, cases of COVID-19 have declined following a\nwave in some areas, whereas other areas are experiencing subsequent waves of activity.\nFortunately, many vaccine candidates are under development and undergoing regulatory\n– approval processes (31 35). Recently, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been the\ncensed for use and are rapidly being administered as supplies are provided (28, 36).\nHowever, given the time required for adequate immunization coverage in the population\n– at large, subsequent pandemic waves are anticipated (31, 37\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ rmed cases and\nrst pandemic of the 21st\nR naught ( R ),\n0\nﬁ 9).

While common in diagnostic labo-\nratories worldwide, many laboratories remain faced with supply chain shortages for\nreal-time RT-PCR reagents and consumables, all while being asked to increase testing\ncapacity. As such, delays were common for test results, prompting the exploration of\nalternative testing options such as specimen pooling or laboratory testing using meth-\nods other than RT-PCR. Methods that could enhance testing capacity, streamline test-\ning (i.e., automation), or provide more rapid results in easy-to-use formats that are\namenable to point-of-care (POC) applications without complex instrumentation (e.g.,\n– isothermal technologies) were all desired (41\nfrom the academic to industry partners, and this research is ongoing to develop testing\nalternatives or complements to existing technologies.\nWhile recent reviews have been published on the management of SARS-CoV-2\n– (41, 47 55), recent advancements in novel diagnostic methods justify the need for\na more comprehensive synthesis of the current literature. In this review,\nbiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are described in order to fully understand\nthe molecular and immunological methods for its detection. Following a brief discussion\non the COVID-19 manifestations, compatible signs and symptoms, and disease biomarkers,\ndiagnostic imaging techniques are described in relation to COVID-19 lower respiratory\ntract involvement, including applications such as monitoring disease severity, the progres-\nsion of the illness, or complications. Next, a comprehensive review of current and recent\nadvances in molecular, antigen (Ag), and serological immunodiagnostic methods is cov-\nered, including rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) used in the laboratory setting and POC appli-\ncations. Overall, this review expands our knowledge of current and exploratory avenues\nfor detecting SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.\nIt should be noted that some of the references used in this review were preprints\nthat have not been peer reviewed, and recognizing that data on the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, some details on testing options and\nguidelines may no longer be recent and should thus be reviewed in the context of recent\nﬁ ndings and recommendations. Nonetheless, this review provides a comprehensive\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\n– 30). Of note, while SARS-CoV-2 was\n47).

SARS-CoV-2 was\n– in China in January 2020 (10 12). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that\nSARS-CoV-2 has a diameter in the range of 60 to 140 nm, and its morphology was con-\nsistent with those of other members of the Coronaviridae\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus, and on the genetic level, it\nshares 96%, 80%, and 50% sequence identities with bat coronavirus (RaTG13), SARS-\nCoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively (11,\n56). Based on these analyses, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses\nnamed the virus SARS-CoV-2, which was formerly referred to as the 2019 novel corona-\nvirus (2019-nCoV) or human coronavirus 2019 (hCoV-19) (25).\nOur understanding of SARS-CoV-2 structure and function has been largely derived\nfrom research on SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 has\na single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of between 26 and 35 kb, encoding\napproximately 27 proteins with similarity to proteins of known functions, while others\nare unclear/unknown or putative (Fig. 2B) (21, 37, 53, 57, 58). The\n9 ; frame (ORF1a/b) on the 5 end of the viral genome occupies\n’ nome and produces two polyproteins (pp s), pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins\nare processed by the viral proteases into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp\nproteins are collectively involved in polyprotein processing, viral RNA replication, and\nmRNA synthesis (53, 57). The remaining proteins, including the structural and acces-\nsory proteins, are expressed from several nested subgenomic mRNAs produced\nthrough a process known as discontinuous transcription by the viral RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase (RdRp).\nThe structural proteins include the small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) pro-\ntein (also known as the matrix protein), nucleocapsid (N) protein, hemagglutinin-ester-\nase (HE) protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein (Fig. 2A) (57, 59). The E and M proteins are\nprimarily involved in viral assembly, budding, and virion morphogenesis (60\nthe N protein complexes with the viral genomic RNA to generate the nucleocapsid\n(63). The S protein is the major surface glycoprotein on SARS-CoV-2, forming\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nrst isolated and sequenced\nfamily (Fig. 2A) (12, 25).\nﬁ rst open reading\n71% of the entire ge-\n’ s), and these\n– 62), while\n4 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nMethods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\napproximately 40 trimers that play an important role in both receptor binding and\nmembrane fusion through the two functional subunits S1 and S2 (37, 64). The S protein\ntrimers contain a stable stalk separated from the globular heads by three\nhinges, allowing for orientation freedom to interact with host cell receptors (65). The S1 subu-\nnit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell surface, whereas the S2 subunit contains\na structural loop responsible for fusion events between the viral and host cell membranes,\nresulting in the release of the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm (66, 67). Of note, along\nwith engaging the ACE2 host cell receptor, the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 is engaged\nfor S protein priming, and this cofactor has been investigated as a possible antiviral target\nusing viral entry inhibitors (68, 69).\nOverall, having knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis can help in understanding\ndisease manifestations and help guide the development of molecular and immunolog-\nﬁ ical tools for the identi cation of this virus.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF COVID-19\nThe spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection can vary from asymptomatic infection to life-\nthreatening complications of COVID-19 (37). Using modeling, it was estimated that\nover 59% of transmissions arise from asymptomatic individuals, with 35% from individ-\nuals in presymptomatic stages of infection and 24% from individuals who never de-\nvelop symptoms (70). These estimates are concerning but emphasize the need for the\nwide use of vaccines and maintaining key public health interventions like mask wear-\ning, hand hygiene, and social distancing.\nIn most symptomatic cases, COVID-19 presents as a mild to moderate upper respira-\ntory illness, with signs and symptoms compatible with those of other respiratory\nviruses (71). As such, the diagnostic accuracy of any individual sign or symptom is very\npoor, and neither the presence nor the absence of any sign or symptom can be used\nto rule in or out COVID-19 (71). With the possibility of other pathogens that could pres-\nﬁ ent like SARS-CoV-2 infection, case de nitions based on clinical presentation are not\nﬁ ﬁ suf ciently speci c but can help support the investigation of suspect COVID-19 cases.\nOn the other hand, given that the list of possible presentations and atypical manifesta-\ntions of COVID-19 could mirror those of other diseases, identifying the etiology of ill-\nness as SARS-CoV-2 requires laboratory testing.\nIn a recent Cochrane review, a summary of 16 studies (7,706 patients) was presented\n(71). Only six of the possible signs and symptoms of COVID-19 had sensitivities of\nand results were highly variable between studies and settings. The most common signs\nand symptoms (and their performances) are summarized as follows: cough (with sensitiv-\nﬁ ity and speci city from 43 to 71% and 14 to 54%, respectively), sore throat (5 to 71% and\n55 to 80%), fever (7 to 91% and 16% to 94%), musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., arthralgias\nor myalgias) (19 to 86% and 45 to 91%), fatigue (10 to 57% and 60 to 94%), and head-\nache (3 to 71% and 78 to 98%) (71). It was noted that possible confounders were pres-\nent, and the high heterogeneity between data suggested that signs and symptoms are\nvariable between individuals (71). Other less common clinical presentations have been\ndocumented, including alterations in smell or taste (i.e., anosmia or dysgeusia) as well as\n– – neurological or cutaneous manifestations (17 19, 72\nearly stages of the pandemic, some of these symptoms may have been missed or under-\nreported, but knowledge on possible clinical presentations of COVID-19 have evolved\nover time.\nIn some cases of COVID-19, progression to lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., pneu-\nmonia) can occur and may require hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) support,\nand mechanical ventilation, and complications can arise, which include acute respira-\n– tory distress, multiorgan dysfunction, and death (71, 77\ncomes and deaths are more common with increasing age or in individuals with under-\nlying medical comorbidities such as respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease,\n– and diabetes (78 80). Fatality rates vary among studies and countries but are generally\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬂ exible\n. 50%,\n76). It is noteworthy that in the\n85).

In terms of recovery, the me-\ndian duration of hospital stay is 10 to 14 days, and resolution generally occurs within 2\nto 3 weeks (85). There is a lack of evidence on whether some symptoms can persist af-\nter recovery. In one study, patients were monitored up to 60 days after recovery, with\n87.4% reporting at least one symptom (86). The most common symptoms were fatigue\n(53.1%), dyspnea (43.4%), joint pain (27.3%), and chest pain (21.7%).\nOverall, while some signs or symptoms may be compatible with COVID-19, none\nﬁ ﬁ are speci c, and laboratory testing is required to con\nare required to help identify the frequency of atypical clinical presentations, and addi-\ntional studies looking at known clinical presentations of COVID-19 should consider\npossible confounders such as the possibility of other etiologies, host factors (e.g.,\ncomorbidities), disease severity, and the times from infection and symptom onset.\nBIOMARKERS FOR COVID-19 AND ROUTINE LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS\nﬁ Apart from laboratory tests speci c for detecting SARS-CoV-2 discussed throughout\nthis review, routine laboratory testing spanning hematological, biochemical, and\n’ chemical markers is used to assess a patient s health or identify possible clues to a dis-\n– ease state (87 90). Such routine laboratory workup of individuals is used to re\nmedical differential diagnosis, thereby supporting or refuting potential causes of the\nclinical presentation based on typical outcomes of these investigations for a de\ndisease. Many of these investigations can evolve through the clinical course of illness,\nand additional testing can be ordered by physicians based on the clinical presentation.\nThese can include tests such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, markers for in\ntory conditions (C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin [PCT], or interleukin 6 [IL-6]),\ntests for anticoagulation, and indicators of tissue damage (alanine aminotransferase\n[ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatine ki-\nnase [CK]). While biomarkers for COVID-19 have been the subject of much investigation\nduring the current pandemic, none of these tests are sensitive or speci\nIn a Cochrane review analyzing 67 laboratory tests from 21 studies encompassing\n14,126 COVID-19 cases and 56,585 non-COVID-19 cases, only three markers showed\nﬁ . sensitivity and speci city values of 50%: a decrease in the lymphocyte count and\nﬂ increases in the in ammatory markers CRP and IL-6 (90). Overall, no individual bio-\nmarker can be used reliably to rule COVID-19 in or out, and laboratory testing should\nbe performed. However, it should be noted that some laboratory markers have value\nfor patient management as they can help assess the severity of the disease or progres-\nsion of the illness or even act as risk factors for death. In the most recent Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance documents for clinicians caring for\npatients with COVID-19, a summary of important laboratory tests is described, with\nﬁ lymphopenia being the most common laboratory\nCOVID-19 (87). Laboratory markers associated with increased illness severity include\nlymphopenia, neutropenia, and elevated serum ALT, AST, LDH, CRP, and ferritin (87,\nﬂ 88). Patients with critical illness have high plasma levels of in\nelevated levels of d-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with an increased\nrisk of death.\nOf note, this section is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all biomarkers\nused in routine or exploratory investigations for COVID-19. We recognize the availabil-\nity of guidelines for clinicians caring for patients with suspected or con\nwith SARS-CoV-2 (87, 88) as well as the expertise of medical staff in ordering laboratory\ntests to help guide evolving differential diagnoses throughout the clinical course of ill-\nness.

Testing of specimens from the lower respiratory\nﬂ tract (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] uid) is possible using nucleic acid ampli\ntion tests (NAATs) like RT-PCR, but obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens is not\n– always possible (104 107). Along with laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging can com-\nplement investigations of COVID-19 to assess the involvement of disease in the lower\nrespiratory tract or other anatomical sites. Diagnostic imaging techniques include chest\nradiography (or chest X ray [CXR]), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography-CT (PET/CT)\n– (108 116). Among these, CT scans are the most frequently used methods for diagnosis\n– of lower tract involvement or follow-up of COVID-19 cases (110\ncross-sectional images at different angles, thereby providing a three-dimensional (3D)\nlook at the targeted anatomy. Chest CT scan images can be assembled and assessed\nby radiologists to check for possible abnormalities suggestive of lower tract disease\nsuch as viral pneumonia (53, 112, 117). Typical features of a chest CT image in COVID-\n19 are ground-glass or reticular opacities (GGOs) with or without consolidations that\npresent bilaterally, peripherally, or in posterior distributions (113).\nThe utility of diagnostic imaging for routine screening for COVID-19 has been a sub-\nject of debate and has not been recommended by most radiology societies (113, 114,\n– 118 121). On the other hand, due to the shortage of RT-PCR supplies during the early\ndays of the pandemic and the possibility of false-negative RT-PCR results from sam-\npling the upper respiratory tract, some hospitals in the Hubei province of China\nincluded CT scans in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (53, 117, 122, 123). While\ndiagnostic imaging techniques like CT have merits to help assess lower respiratory\ntract disease involvement, to monitor disease progression, or to investigate other com-\nplications of COVID-19, it should be noted that diagnostic imaging methods are less\nsensitive than sampling the lower respiratory tract and testing using molecular meth-\nﬁ ods, and speci city is low, given that typical features of COVID-19 are common to other\n– – respiratory viruses or illnesses (113 116, 124\nscans in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suggested an increased sensitivity of CT over real-\ntime RT-PCR, but others have suggested explanations for the disparities between RT-\nPCR results and diagnostic imaging assessments, including poor sampling techniques,\ndifferences in the performances of testing methods, the anatomical site of RT-PCR test-\ning (upper versus lower tract), and disease prevalence (111, 124, 126, 129\n. sensitivities (i.e., 90%) have been reported for CT scans in high-prevalence popula-\n, tions, while low sensitivities ( 60%) were reported in studies with low-prevalence pop-\n– – ﬁ ulations (112 114, 118 121, 123). In a Cochrane review for con\nﬁ 19, the pooled sensitivities were 93.1% (95% con\nfor chest CT and 82.1% (95% CI, 62.5% to 92.7%) for CXR, but heterogeneity between\nﬁ studies was considerable (121). Speci city for diagnostic imaging is low, at 18.1% (95%\nCI, 3.7 to 55.8%) (121). In other words, approximately 80% of individuals would have\nreceived a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the absence of disease. As such, the use of diag-\nnostic imaging techniques should be accompanied by careful consideration of factors\nsuch as disease prevalence in the study population, severity of the illness, performance\nand context of the methods used, differences in radiologist opinions, and possible con-\n– – – founding diagnoses (112 114, 118 121, 123, 126, 132\nalso important to recognize that diagnostic imaging is a useful tool for patient man-\nﬁ agement with or without a con rmed etiology through laboratory testing, as it can be\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ ca-\n112).

AI-based methods can be used in diagnostic\nimaging to help recognize abnormal features in images and classify them into de\ncategories, thus increasing accuracy, standardization, and speed of analyses by radiol-\n– ogists (50, 109, 142 146). AI approaches can be categorized into three main groups:\napproaches that analyze CT scan images, methods based on X ray, and those that real-\nize diagnosis through jointly analyzing CT scan and X-ray images (147\nﬁ based applications have shown bene ts for diagnostic imaging methodologies (50,\n109, 145, 146), more clinical investigations are needed to evaluate their possible incor-\nporation into routine procedures for investigations of suspected cases of COVID-19,\nﬁ and laboratory testing is required to con rm the disease etiology. Furthermore, acquir-\ning a reliable AI-based system requires access to a comprehensive training data set\nthat includes all variations of COVID-19 as well as other lung diseases; providing such\nﬁ an all-inclusive data set is dif cult and labor-intensive.\nLABORATORY METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-CoV-2\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 can be performed using molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2\nRNA, which is now widely available. Immunodiagnostic methods for identifying viral\nantigens and serology to recognize an immune response to the virus are also available.\nThe following sections describe the commonly used and potential methods for the lab-\noratory detection of SARS-CoV-2, with important consideration for factors like speci-\nmen type and timing of specimen collection.\nSpecimen Types\nPrior to describing methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, it should be recognized that\naccurate detection of any infectious disease requires adequate specimen collection at\nthe anatomical site of infection, at a time when the pathogen of interest should be\n– present (152 154). While the virus has been detected in a variety of specimen types\n– using molecular methods (26, 96, 155 161), few have been widely adopted due to\nunreliable detection or a lack of sensitivity. The use of blood, serum, or plasma for\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2-speci c serology and other immunodiagnostic tests is discussed in later\nsections of this review.\nFor respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, specimens collected from the upper respira-\nﬂ tory tract using a ocked nasopharyngeal (NP) swab that is placed in universal or viral\ntransport medium (UTM or VTM, respectively) are the gold standards (162\ntrast to other swabs (e.g., cotton swabs on wooden sticks), specimen collection using\nﬂ ﬁ ocked NP swabs that are coated with multilength\nof respiratory viruses and bacteria, and the UTM or VTM allows a stable medium for\ntransport to the laboratory (133). Other than NP swab specimens, alternative speci-\nmens and collection methods have been validated and gained interest, including the\nuse of nasal midturbinate swabs, sampling of the anterior nares (Na), oropharyngeal\n(OP) swabs, or washes/aspirates from the nasopharynx, nose, or throat (96, 97, 154,\n– 165 172). Specimen combinations can also be used. For example, paired collection\nusing an OP swab along with sampling of the anterior nares was shown to be equiva-\nlent to NP swab collection for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and different options are\navailable for OP/Na collection (133, 154, 167, 168, 173). It is worth mentioning that dur-\ning the COVID-19 pandemic, procurement of NP swabs and UTM (or VTM) was chal-\nlenged by global supply chain shortages. Several groups have developed and validated\nthe possibility of using 3D-printed swabs as alternatives to commercial NP or nasal\nswabs, but while some have been clinically validated for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA,\nfurther investigations are required for their applicability in SARS-CoV-2 antigen detec-\n– tion (174 178). For media used for swab transport to laboratories, other than the typi-\ncal UTM or VTM, alternatives have been investigated for use for SARS-CoV-2 testing,\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ncial intelligence (AI) (also\nﬁ ned\n– 151).

When lower tract infection\nis suspected through clinical presentation or with the aid of diagnostic imaging, speci-\nﬂ mens such as BAL uid, endotracheal secretions, or sputum should be considered (55,\n– 95 102, 180).\nRecently, the use of noninvasive collection methods like saliva and throat gargles\nhas gained much interest, as these samples are amenable to self-collection and have\n– the potential for large-scale population-based surveillance (181\nies have demonstrated that the performance of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\nwas comparable to that of NP or nasal swab collections (183, 184, 187\nchallenged the performance of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (191). The variability in\nsaliva collection or differences in the patient populations tested might explain these\ninconsistencies, but further analyses are required (191, 192). Also, although not used\nroutinely in many laboratories, detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool is possible in the\npresence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms (193). The possibility of culturing\nSARS-CoV-2 from stool opens discussions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral trans-\nmission and human health or ecological risks (194, 195) and also opens the opportu-\nnity for research into community-based surveillance in low-prevalence settings using\nwastewater (193, 196).\nIn postmortem examinations, the extent of investigations will be dependent on sev-\neral factors, but NP swabs, swabs from the lungs, and tissue samples can be used for\n– diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 (197 200). Specimens in 10% buffered neutral saline\nﬁ ﬁ or formalin- xed paraf n-embedded (FFPE) specimens commonly used for histopatho-\nlogical examinations can also be used, but these pose challenges for NAATs like real-\ntime RT-PCR as RNA can be degraded by formalin, and sensitivity for the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR could be compromised (201). The CDC recom-\nmends that these media be used in limited settings (197). Immunohistochemical (IHC)\nand in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have now been\ndeveloped, but limited data are available on their performance (202).\nTiming of Specimen Collection\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2 has been identi ed in various clinical specimen types (26, 96, 154\nbut the timing of detection differs between methods and the specimen types collected\nfor testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected early in the presymptomatic stage of the\ndisease and later on, even after recovery. However, the timing of specimen collection\nis critical, as testing too early or too late following exposure can potentially lead to\nfalse-negative results (203). It was shown that real-time RT-PCR false-negative rates\ncould be minimized by testing 2 to 3 days after symptom onset, with an average time\n– of symptom onset of 5 days postexposure (204\nfor individuals with an initial negative test result but for whom there is a high level of\nclinical suspicion (134). Of note, viral shedding studies are often performed using RNA\ndetection alone and less often in combination with virus culture; however, the absence\nof cultivable virus does not preclude the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and\nlaboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular methods does not imply infec-\n– tious virus (208, 211 217). For the purpose of this section, viral shedding is described\nin the context of RNA detection without implying the potential for viral transmission. A\ndiscussion regarding the association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with potential infec-\ntivity is covered later in this section as well as in the real-time RT-PCR section below.\nThe magnitude of the viral load and duration of shedding depend on the specimen\ntype, the anatomical site of illness, the severity of illness, and, likely, the host immune\n– response to infection (170, 208, 218 220). The average duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA\ndetection in the upper respiratory tract of patients with mild disease ranged from 7.9\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\n186).

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract ranged from 8\nto 38.4 days for mild cases of COVID-19 and spanned between 6 and 26.9 days for mod-\nerate to severe illness (221). In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled esti-\nmates of the mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset in\nmild adult cases were 12.1 days (95% CI, 10.1 to 14.1 days) in the upper respiratory\ntract and 24.1 days (95% CI, 10.0 to 38.2 days) in the lower respiratory tract. For moder-\nate to severe cases, the pooled estimates for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity\nin the upper respiratory tract were 15.8 days (95% CI, 11.1 to 20.6 days) and 23.2 days\n(95% CI, 21.5 to 25.0 days) in the lower respiratory tract (221). In a systematic review\nand meta-analysis, the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were strati\nCOVID-19 severity and sampling site. In cases of mild adult disease, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in\nthe upper respiratory tract was maximal on day 4, at approximately 6.6\n\u0001 ml, whereas lower tract viral loads peaked at approximately 2.7\n6 after symptom onset (221). In cases of moderate to severe adult disease, maximal\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the upper respiratory tract occurred on day 8, at 4.6\n8 \u0001 copies/ml, and on day 11, at approximately 3.5 10\ntract (221). Regarding the differences in viral loads and durations of shedding between\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic patients, the literature is inconsistent. Some publications\nobserved little to no difference in viral loads between the two groups (222\nﬁ others suggested signi cantly higher viral loads in symptomatic patients (224). Whether\nthese differences are attributed to differences in disease severity, variations in the perform-\nances of methods used, or host factors remains to be determined.\nAs highlighted above, the median duration of viral shedding is variable between\nindividuals and likely dependent on disease severity and several host factors such as age,\nimmunocompromising conditions, or medical comorbidities (208, 212\nWhile most individuals with mild disease clear the virus within 10 to 20days, in some cases\nwith severe COVID-19, the duration of shedding can be prolonged (217, 230). The longest\ndurations of viral RNA shedding reported to date were 83 and 111days after symptom\nonset (231, 232); however, the persistence of RNA suggestive of low viral loads may be of\nﬁ little clinical signi cance, as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not necessarily imply\n– – infectivity (170, 208, 212 220, 227 229). Moreover, many factors can affect the detection\nof SARS-CoV-2 RNA, such as the quality of sample collection, transport, and variables in\nlaboratory processing; RNA positivity can be intermittent and inaccurate at the later stages\nof illness (233). Therefore, the CDC recommends that the discontinuation of transmission-\nﬁ based precautions for patients with con rmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be based on\nthe resolution of symptoms and not based on testing (230). While some countries have\nsimilar recommendations for discharge from quarantine, there is some heterogeneity in\napproaches, and these often vary based on the severity of illness and the presence or ab-\nsence of symptoms (234).\nWhile not used routinely in many laboratories, detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from\nstool is possible in the presence or absence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (193, 235).\nHowever, only 1% of patients had detectable RNA in their stool in the absence of positive re-\nspiratory specimens (193, 235). For some patients, viral shedding in stool can occur for a lon-\nger period than in the respiratory samples and could help diagnose infection if upper and\nlower respiratory tract specimens are negative but there is a high suspicion of disease\n– (156 160, 193, 236). Of individuals who test positive with GI specimens, the median duration\nof RNA shedding in the GI tract is 12.5days following negative respiratory tract specimens\n(193, 235). Less frequently, shedding in stool can be prolonged and has been documented\nup to 70days after symptom onset or 33days following clearance from the respiratory tract\n(236, 237). As for respiratory tract specimens, RNA detection does not necessarily imply that\ninfectious virions are produced, but SARS-CoV-2 has been cultured from stool specimens in\nsome studies (236, 237).\nLike molecular methods, antigen testing can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins\nin the acute stages of the disease following the incubation period in upper respiratory\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ ed by\n8 \u0001 10 copies/\n8 10 copies/ml on day\n9 \u0001 10\ncopies/ml, in the lower respiratory\n– 226), while\n– – 217, 227 229).\n10 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nMethods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\ntract specimens such as NP swabs, nasal swabs, and possibly saliva. Antigen detection\nﬂ using immunoassays like lateral ow rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is often less sensitive\nthan molecular methods (203, 238), but these tests can detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen reliably\nwhen the viral load is high in the clinical specimens (i.e., typically from 1 to 3days before\nthe onset of symptoms to 5 to 7days after symptom onset), whereas the likelihood of\nSARS-CoV-2 detection decreases in the second week after symptom onset (238).\nIn contrast to RNA and antigen detection, immunological responses take longer to\nappear, with antibodies typically beginning to appear 6 days after symptom onset, as\nﬁ viral RNA levels begin to decline (207). Typically, the\nblood is immunoglobulin M (IgM), followed by immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, con-\ncomitant increases of the IgM and IgG immunoglobulin classes as well as IgG\nconversion have also been observed (239). Few data are also available for immuno-\nglobulin A (IgA) detection, a marker of mucosal immune responses, but it is evident\nthat both IgA and IgM decline rapidly over the course of infection (240). The median\nseroconversion times for total antibody, IgM, and IgG were 9, 10, and 12 days after\nsymptom onset (or 15, 18, and 20 days after exposure), respectively (240). It is unclear\nhow long IgG responses last or whether they confer protection against subsequent\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfection (241). The longest study on the antibody dynamics tracked IgG\nup to 115 days after symptom onset in sera and saliva (242). Immune responses may\nvary depending on disease severity and host factors such as immunocompromising\nconditions or other medical comorbidities, and the value of immune responses will be\ndependent on the ability to provide neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) or cellular immunity\ncapable of viral clearance. The applications and limitations of serology and other\nimmunodiagnostics are discussed in more detail in later sections of this paper.\nSpecimen Preprocessing Requirements\nWhile detection of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens can be performed using\nRNA or antigen detection, they sometimes require a preprocessing step like heat lysis\nor inactivation using guanidinium salts before nucleic acid extraction and ampli\nor testing, to ensure safe handling conditions, depending on local biosafety risk assess-\nments (133, 154, 173, 180). Specimen types such as sputum may require mucolytic\nagents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), N -acetyl- L\nreduce specimen viscosity prior to testing (243). Other preprocessing steps would\ninclude centrifugation for specimens like stool (236), PK digests for tissues (e.g., lung\nbiopsy specimens), and specimen aliquoting into compatible tubes for testing (if test-\ning from primary specimen containers is not possible). With any manipulation of the\nprimary specimen (i.e., preprocessing steps), careful consideration should be under-\ntaken to ensure that there are no potential impacts on downstream testing (e.g., RNA\nor antigen stability). Of note, some preprocessing steps, like specimen lysis, can be\ndone in conjunction with nucleic acid extraction using automated instrumentation\n(discussed below in the real-time RT-PCR section of this review).\nOverall, the choice of the specimen and timing of collection are crucial for the accu-\nrate detection of SARS-CoV-2, as are factors such as the severity of illness. Given that\nthe performance characteristics of diagnostic methods depend on numerous variables\nas well as the method(s) used as a comparator and disease prevalence, a comprehen-\nsive synthesis of all method performances falls outside the scope of this review.\nHowever, general concepts for performance characteristics, important considerations,\nand a description of the technologies used for SARS-CoV-2 detection in the clinical set-\nting or in development are presented in the following sections.\nMolecular Methods for Viral RNA Detection\nWhile no true reference standard exists for detecting SARS-CoV-2, nucleic acid\nﬁ ampli cation tests (NAATs) such as real-time RT-PCR are the methods of choice for\nSARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing (40, 41, 48, 53, 54, 244).

Among NAATs, real-time RT-PCR is the most widely used method\nfor the detection of SARS-CoV-2. As shown in Fig. 3A, the sample work\nCoV-2 real-time RT-PCR includes specimen collection, transportation of the samples to\nﬁ the laboratory, specimen lysis, puri cation of viral RNA through nucleic acid extraction,\nﬁ and real-time RT-PCR ampli cation, detection, and analysis. Prior to real-time RT-PCR\nﬁ ampli cation, specimens are lysed to provide access to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and\nnucleic acid extraction is performed to remove potential inhibitors that could impede\nﬁ the ampli cation of the target. Both lysis/extraction and RT-PCR ampli\nperformed sequentially through manual processing on individual instruments, or the\nentire process can be automated.\nﬁ (i) Specimen lysis and RNA puri cation. To release viral RNA from host cells and vi-\nrions, specimen lysis can be performed using physical (e.g., heat, sonication, or homog-\nenization), chemical (e.g., organic solvents, detergents, chelating agents, or chaotropic\nagents), or enzymatic (e.g., proteases) methods (54, 243, 248, 249). Lysis steps based\non enzymatic digestion (e.g., proteinase K digestion) are common for nucleic acid\nextraction in clinical laboratories. Following specimen lysis, extraction of viral RNA is\nperformed to remove cellular debris and contaminants that could potentially inhibit\n– the RT-PCR and purify the nucleic acids (250\nsilica-coated magnetic microbeads are used to capture nucleic acids, which can be\nsequentially transferred into different wash solutions by a robotic pipetting instrument\n– ﬁ with a magnetic head (248 252). The ef ciencies of several extraction methods have\nbeen compared for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the results favor commercial kits over\nmanual methods like organic extractions containing guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-\nchloroform (253).\nIt should be noted that while nucleic acid extraction is essential to achieve optimal\nsensitivity in molecular assays, recent studies have described extraction-free protocols\nfor molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the potential bottleneck of extrac-\ntion if the supply of extraction reagents or consumables is limited (or to provide\n– options for low-income environments) (254\nextraction step to remove PCR inhibitors in clinical specimens, there is a notable reduc-\ntion in sensitivity, but the extent is dependent on the method and target used for\nSARS-CoV-2 detection, the type and duration of the lysis/inactivation method (heat or\nchemical), the input volume, the specimen type, the transport media, and the viral\n– load in the specimen (253, 257, 263 265). For example, the sensitivity of a 60-min heat\ninactivation alone reached 100% for specimens with moderate to high viral loads\n(threshold cycle [ C ] values of between 20 and 30) but declined to 54% in specimens\nT\n. with C values of 30 (264).\nT\nﬁ ﬁ (ii) Target ampli cation and detection.

(A) Typical steps required for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with real-time RT-\nPCR. (B) Principle of real-time RT-PCR. (1) During reverse transcription, reverse transcriptase (RT) creates a cDNA\nfrom the viral RNA template, with the aid of the reverse primer (or random oligonucleotides). The RNase H\nactivity of the RT digests the initial RNA template. (2) The DNA polymerase activity of RT (or of the\npolymerase) completes the second DNA strand guided by the forward primer and cDNA. (3) The newly formed\ndouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is used as a template for the PCR portion of the assay. At the annealing stage,\nﬁ the reverse primer binds to the sense strand of dsDNA in a sequence-speci\nand a dually labeled probe bind to the antisense strand of the DNA. In this stage, the\non the probe is masked by the quencher (Q). During the extension step, the DNA polymerase extends the\nforward primer and, in the process, hydrolyzes the probe, resulting in the release of the\nﬂ following excitation, uorescence emission can be captured by the real-time thermocycler. With each round of\nﬁ PCR ampli cation, the dsDNA amplicon is multiplied by a 2-fold factor, with a proportional increase in the\nﬂ ﬁ overall uorescence signal. After 30 to 40 cycles of ampli\nﬂ which the uorescence signal crosses the threshold for positivity is called the threshold cycle (\nvalues are inversely proportional to the quantity of the target present in the reaction mixture.\noccurred is termed the threshold cycle ( C ).

Typically, real-time RT-PCR assays demonstrate high\nﬁ sensitivity and speci city for SARS-CoV-2. In a systematic review and meta-analysis by\nMustafa Hellou et al., the pooled sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection from 29 studies\nﬁ was 96.2% (95% CI, 91.0% to 98.4%), and the pooled speci\n95.9% to 99.2%) (106). Sensitivity is of the utmost importance to ensure that cases in a\nﬁ ﬁ population are identi ed, and speci city is important to ensure that no false-positive\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nTaq\nc manner, and the forward primer\nﬂ uorophore (F) present\nﬂ uorophore.

SARS-CoV-2 NAATs like real-time RT-PCR do not cross-react with other re-\nspiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses.\n(iii) SARS-CoV-2 targets and data interpretation.\nfor SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR, but the genes encoding E, N, S, and ORF1ab are used\n– widely (40, 41, 53, 275 279). Despite limited access to control materials early in the\npandemic, LeBlanc et al. assessed the analytical performances of various LDTs and\ncommercial RT-PCR assays and found that most of them had a high sensitivity with\nsimilar limits of detection (LoDs) in the range of 3.4 to 4.5 log\n10\nﬁ copies/reaction) (40). Similar pro ciency testing across laboratories has been per-\nﬁ formed by others, demonstrating high sensitivity and speci\n– methods and instruments (280 282).\nIn the initial stages of the pandemic, dual- or multigene detection strategies were\nﬁ adopted for real-time RT-PCRs to ensure assay speci\ngressed and the disease prevalence increased, some laboratories implemented single-\nﬂ target detection of SARS-CoV-2 in LDTs to streamline the work\ncommercial methods continue to rely on detection using two or more targets (283). In\nﬁ duplex or multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays, if the identi\nered a positive result, sensitivity would be enhanced compared to the requirement of\nat least two targets to be positive for a SARS-CoV-2 result to be released as such (40).\nHowever, this strategy comes at the risk of decreasing the speci\nincreasing the false-positivity rate (40). Regardless of the approach for testing, each tar-\nﬁ get should have a validated range of values that de\nminate result as well as conditions that would trigger an invalid result (e.g., processing\nor quality failures) (40, 284). C values can be used in real-time RT-PCR to de\nT\ncutoffs, and indeterminate (or equivocal) results arise for values falling between the\ncutoff values of negative results and the reproducible C\nT\nis sometimes termed the diagnostic gray zone for result interpretation (40, 285).\nLow C values suggest that more viral RNA was present in the specimen, whereas\nT\nhigh C values represent specimens with lower virus burdens, as more cycles were\nT\nrequired to amplify the viral target. Therefore, C\nT\ngate for viral load. While low viral loads (indicated by high C\nT\nﬁ early or late disease, they could also be explained by nonspeci\npositive reactions), poor collection techniques, specimen integrity issues during stor-\nage or transport, or a problem occurring during laboratory processing. As discussed in\nthe section on the timing of specimen collection above, some studies have evaluated\n– the correlation between C values and infectivity (208, 211\nT\nto suggest that specimens that have SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results with\ncannot be effectively grown in tissue culture (212), yet other data have shown that\nSARS-CoV-2 can be recovered from cultured specimens with a C\nlower frequency (213, 214). While methodologies may have differed between studies\nto explain these differences (e.g., fresh versus frozen specimens), it should be noted\nthat the infectious dose required for human infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown\nﬂ and in uenced by many biological and environmental variables. Given the variability\nthat can occur in specimen collection, transport, and processing, there are no biologi-\ncal correlates accurately linking C values to infectivity or the potential for transmission.\nT\nDetectable virus by NAATs does not imply infectious virus. Of note, even if such a cor-\nrelate existed, C value cutoffs cannot be applied universally to all NAATs, as they are\nT\nﬁ method, reagent, and target speci c, and to date, there is no international standard\nthat can be used for calibration. Of note, other studies have investigated the role of\nvalues in predicting the clinical course of COVID-19 or prognosis (286, 287); however,\nﬂ given the number of factors that could in uence C\nT\nstandardize respiratory specimens, the role of C\nT\noutcomes would likely be inconsistent, and further research is needed. While the inter-\npretation of C values requires careful consideration, it is clear that\nT\non the viral burden, which itself varies throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection.

If clinically indicated, patients with high C\nT\ning within 24 to 48 h to determine if the C value is stable, rising, or declining to help\nT\nstage potential exposures in contact tracing (167, 168, 230, 288). However,\ninterpretation is complicated in asymptomatic infections, where the time of infection\nonset may be unknown. Therefore, to rule out potential false-positive results, repeat\ntesting is recommended for patients with high C\nT\n(167, 168, 230, 288).\n(iv) Automation. LDTs and commercial assays for moderate- to high-throughput\ntesting for SARS-CoV-2 require relatively expensive equipment and experienced per-\nsonnel to obtain accurate and robust data, and the turnaround time for results can\ntake several hours. Real-time RT-PCR assays are constantly being improved to increase\nspecimen throughput, provide rapid specimen turnaround times, reduce the hands-on\ntime, and facilitate result interpretation and reporting. Automated high-throughput\ninstruments are capable of performing over 1,000 tests daily, with performance charac-\nteristics greater than or equivalent to those of LDTs (167, 168, 251, 289\nﬁ cally require separate nucleic acid extraction and ampli\nesses can occur simultaneously with high-throughput instruments, along with full\ntraceability, and results can be directly reported through interfacing with the labora-\nﬁ tory information system. One of the rst high-throughput instruments with a commer-\ncially available SARS-CoV-2 detection assay was the cobas 6800 instrument (Roche\nMolecular Systems, USA), but other highly automated instruments relying on NAAT\ntechnology are now available, with similar performances, testing capacities, and work-\nﬂ ﬁ ow bene ts. These include the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay on the m2000\ninstrument (Abbott Molecular, USA), the Hologic Panther SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic,\nUSA), the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay (NeuMoDx Molecular, USA), and BD Max\n– reagents (Becton, Dickinson, USA) (296 302). Advances have also been made for LDTs\nfor SARS-CoV-2 testing using semiautomated robotics to streamline specimen process-\nﬁ ing, nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR setup and ampli\ninterfacing for data reporting (295). LDTs for SARS-CoV-2 have also been adapted for\nother instruments, such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). In ddPCR, water-oil emulsions\nare used to partition nucleic acid samples into thousands of nanoliter-sized droplets,\nﬁ – and PCR ampli cation is carried out within each droplet (303\nformance of ddPCR has been shown to be equivalent to or slightly more sensitive than\nLDT comparators, but limited data are available for its use in clinical laboratories\n– (303 306).\n(v) Specimen pooling. Regardless of the NAAT used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, man-\nﬁ ufacturers of nucleic acid puri cation kits or RT-PCR reagents and consumables have\nbeen challenged with the rapid increase in testing demands that came with the global\nspread of SARS-CoV-2. With challenges to meet testing resources and limitations in the\nsupply chain, research into alternative testing strategies has been explored (254). A\npossible strategy to increase testing capacity and gain laboratory ef\ntesting (i.e., specimen pooling) (307). While many pooling permutations are possible,\nits simplest application involves combining patient samples before testing and retest-\nﬁ ing individual specimens following the identi cation of a positive pool (308\noptimal number of specimens within pools (i.e., pool depth) varies with disease preva-\nlence and assay performance (307, 311, 312). While larger pool depths may achieve\nﬁ higher ef ciency, particularly for high-throughput instruments, the trade-off is the\naccompanying reduced sensitivity, with the potential generation of false-negative\nresults (307). When prevalence is low, typically only a subset of specimens with low vi-\nral loads pass undetected, while the testing capacity is increased and the cost of test-\ning is reduced (307, 311, 312). In settings of high disease prevalence, the merits of\npooling are lost given the high number of pools that need to be resolved. Other\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nvalues should undergo repeat test-\nC value\nT\nvalues suggestive of low viral loads\n– 295).

The\n16 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nMethods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\nchallenges for pooling include the increased human resource requirements for speci-\nmen registration and processing, but robotics and pooling software can help mitigate\nsome of these issues (311). For lower-throughput analyzers like NAAT-based RDTs,\npooling can also be considered (312). Overall, while thorough validation and careful\nconsideration of potential impacts of pooling should be considered before implemen-\ntation on any instrument, pooling can offer an opportunity for clinical laboratories to\nincrease testing capacity, reduce costs, and mitigate the supply chain limitations of lab-\noratory testing (311).\n(vi) RT-PCR-based rapid diagnostic tests. Unlike high-throughput automated instru-\nments that are focused on large specimen volumes, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), as their\nname implies, are focused on speed. While this is acceptable for routine testing, RDTs have\nbeen developed to provide rapid results with easy-to-use testing, with minimal hands-on\nﬁ processing steps to facilitate training and testing. The\nthat obtained EUA from the FDA and Canada was the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on\nthe Cepheid GeneXpert platform (Cepheid Inc., USA), which provides results in about\n, 45min, with a 5-min hands-on specimen processing time (27). This NAAT-based RDT\nshowed analytical and clinical performance characteristics often greater than those of\n– LDTs and other commercial NAATs (99, 167, 168, 290\nnoted that while Xpert Xpress is often referred to as a point-of-care (POC) test, this testing\nis not typically performed at the time and place of patient assessment and is more com-\nmonly performed in a laboratory setting; therefore, the term RDT would be more appropri-\nate. The most current version of the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assay is multiplexed with in\nA and B viruses as well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can present with similar\nrespiratory symptoms (315). More highly multiplexed assays like BioFire Respiratory Panel\n2.1 with SARS-CoV-2 (BioFire Diagnostics, USA) are also available, which allow a syndromic\napproach with the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 and several other respiratory\nviruses (316, 317). While syndromic testing is also being developed for larger instruments,\nsuch assays on RDTs are particularly useful for remote communities or resource-limited set-\ntings or for testing of populations where rapid diagnosis would be of bene\nadmitted to the ICU).\nOther devices with a focus on potential POC applications have integrated RT-PCR\nﬂ with rapid (5- to 30-min) technologies such as digital micro\n– readouts, and portable instruments (318 325). All these assays have the advantage of\nspeed and simplicity but are prone to limitations such as low sensitivity, low specimen\nthroughput, and minimal scalability (288). For developing countries or other resource-\nlimited settings where instrumentation is lacking, other cost-sparing testing alterna-\ntives are being explored. Arumugam et al. demonstrated a proof of principle of an RT-\nPCR that could be conducted in 12 min using a setup consisting of thin-walled PCR\ntubes, sous vide immersion heaters/circulators, and an endpoint readout performed\nwith a light-emitting diode (LED) gel-viewing box (326). Such creative and innovative\nsolutions from industry and academic settings help meet the global needs for SARS-\nCoV-2 laboratory testing, besides other NAATs rapidly being developed and validated.\nﬁ Isothermal ampli cation technologies. In efforts to develop portable and rapid\ndiagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, NAATs other than RT-PCR have been investigated.\nﬁ Isothermal ampli cation technologies (IATs) are conducted at a constant temperature,\neliminating the need for expensive equipment such as thermocyclers. The principles\nbehind IATs rely on thermal or enzymatic denaturation of nucleic acids, followed by\nﬁ nucleic acid ampli cation reactions, and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (244).\nIsothermal NAAT technologies include transcription-mediated ampli\nnicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR), loop-mediated isothermal ampli\nﬁ (LAMP), recombinase polymerase ampli cation (RPA), and systems using clustered regu-\n– larly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)\nsystems. While most IAT methods have been applied to DNA, they can often be adapted\nﬁ to RNA ampli cation by adding an RT step (e.g., RT-LAMP and RT-RPA) (244, 271, 327,\nﬁ 328). Other IATs were designed for the intent of RNA ampli\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nrst RDT based on real-time RT-PCR\n292, 296, 313, 314).

The RT-RPA reactions typically occur at between 37°C and 42°C in the\nfollowing steps. (1) The reaction is initiated by the binding of a recombinase (e.g., T4 UvsX) and a\nloading factor (e.g., T4 UvsY) to each of the forward and reverse primers. (2) These recombinase/\nloading factor/oligonucleotide complexes search for homologous sequences in dsDNA, formed in the\nRT reaction from viral RNA (not depicted). (3) Once sequence homology is found, the recombinase\ncomplex invades the duplex DNA, forming a structure called a D-loop in an ATP-dependent reaction,\nwhere there is the unwinding of dsDNA and binding of the primer to its complementary sequence.\nAccess to the primer-binding sequence is possible due to the stabilization of the opposite strand by\nSSBs (e.g., T4 gp32). Subsequently, the recombinase and loading factor disassemble and are released\nto initiate other rounds of target recognition. (4) Following the binding of the forward and reverse\n9 primers, these primers are extended at their 3 ends using a strand displacement DNA polymerase (e.\ng., Bsu ), and during the elongation process, there is a further separation of the two strands. (5)\nEventually, SSBs are displaced, and the replication of both strands is complete.\nhas been commercialized on a high-throughput instrument, but other IATs have been\nexplored for uses as RDTs or for potential POC applications (e.g., RT-RPA, RT-LAMP,\nNEAR, and CRISPR-Cas) (244). The following sections describe examples of IATs and cur-\nrent and potential applications.\nﬁ (i) Reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase ampli cation. As shown in Fig. 4,\nthe mechanism of RPA relies on homologous recombination (329). RT-RPA uses a DNA poly-\nmerase to extend forward and reverse primers and make copies of each DNA strand (like\nPCR). However, to unwind and copy the DNA strands generated from reverse transcription,\nRPA requires the ATP-dependent targeting activity of a recombinase complex as well as the\npolymerase activity of a strand displacement DNA polymerase (e.g., Bsu ) (329, 330).\nWhile the mechanisms for RT-RPA are relatively simple, the reaction components\nare fairly complex. Single-tube RT-RPA reactions include forward and reverse primers,\ncore enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase, recombinase, recombinase loading factor,\nand a strand displacement DNA polymerase), proteins like single-stranded binding pro-\ntein (SSB), and a number of ancillary components such as deoxynucleoside triphos-\nphates (dNTPs), salts, buffers, cofactors, crowding agents, ATP, and an enzymatic\n18 July 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nMethods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\nsystem to generate additional ATP (phosphocreatine and creatine kinase [CK]). Once\n2 1 added, magnesium (Mg ) initiates the RPA reaction. Fortunately, various kits are now\ncommercially available for RPA (e.g., TwistDx, United Kingdom), with variations for the\nprobe used in the detection step (329). For example, the TwistAmp exonuclease (exo)\nﬂ probes are used for uorescence detection through a mechanism involving exonucle-\nﬂ ase III, whereas a detection system designed for a lateral\nbe incorporated using endonuclease IV (nfo) probes (329). Alternative\nﬂ technologies have also been used, such as\n(FRET) probes or CRISPR-Cas technology (271, 327).\nUnlike real-time RT-PCR, RT-RPA does not require sophisticated instrumentation like\nthermocyclers, thereby simplifying the testing process. The ease of use of this isother-\nmal technology makes RT-RPA an attractive candidate for point-of-care molecular tests.\nRT-RPA technology has been applied to the detection of other RNA viruses like Ebola\nvirus (329); however, to date, data presenting its use for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\nﬁ are scarce (271, 327, 331). Kim et al. used a modi\nCoV-2 and achieved a sensitivity of approximately 4 copies/reaction in a 10-min reac-\nﬂ tion that used a lateral ow immunoassay (LFIA) readout. Their RT-RPA correctly identi-\nﬁ ed all 18 contrived specimens generated by spiking heat-inactivated virus into NP\nswabs or saliva (327). A second publication by Xia and Chen described another modi-\nﬁ ed single-tube version of RT-RPA introduced by GenDx called reverse transcription-\nﬁ enzymatic recombinase ampli cation (RT-ERA) as well as the whole-course encapsu-\nﬁ lated procedure for exponential ampli cation from RNA (WEPEAR) protocol (271). The\nWEPEAR protocol contains all the reaction components necessary for RT-ERA, except\n2 ’ 1 the activator Mg , which is loaded into the microtube\nﬁ the tube can be spun and mixed to initiate the modi\nﬂ probes for a uorescence output or nfo probes for LFIA-based detection, the WEPEAR\nprotocol achieved high sensitivity in the range of a single copy per reaction.\nUnfortunately, this method was attempted on only a single clinical specimen and\nwould require further validation. Other applications of the RT-RPA for the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 involve the use of CRISPR-Cas technology, which is covered in a later sec-\n“ ﬁ tion [see Isothermal ampli cation technologies. (v) CRISPR-Cas technology,\nﬁ (ii) Transcription-mediated ampli cation. Transcription-mediated ampli\nﬁ (TMA) is an IAT that ampli es RNA from an RNA template (41, 332\nnology has been applied to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics on high-throughput analyzers\n(296, 322, 335, 336). Figure 5 illustrates the principle of TMA.\nThe Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay is performed on the Hologic Panther instrument, a\nhighly automated instrument capable of processing over 1,000 specimens daily (41).\nﬁ Its principle combines a puri cation step using target capture, TMA for RNA ampli\ntion, and chemiluminescent probes for RNA detection. In the target capture step,\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA is isolated from specimens using magnetic microparticles coupled to\nﬁ oligomers containing sequences complementary to speci\nmolecules as well as polydeoxyadenosine residues. By modifying the temperature, se-\nquential hybridization can occur between the RNA target and the sequence-speci\nportion of the capture oligomers, and a hybridization step then occurs between the\npolydeoxyadenosine region of the capture oligomer and the polydeoxythymidine\nsequence that is covalently bound to the magnetic microparticles (337). After the puri-\nﬁ cation step, TMA reactions occur, while detection is achieved through the hybridiza-\nﬁ tion of sequence-speci c single-stranded oligonucleotide probes labeled with acridin-\nium ester. A reagent is applied to generate a chemiluminescence signal that can\ndistinguish between free and bound probes. A luminometer captures the resulting\nlight emitted from bound probes, expressed as relative light units (RLU).\nThe Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay has only recently been authorized by the FDA\nand Health Canada, but data on its performance are scarce.

All false-negative results corresponded to specimens for which\nvalues were between 35 and 40, suggesting low viral loads.

However, they also noted that the PPA varied with viral loads. When speci-\nmens were categorized by C values, both INDCOV and Xpert showed 100% PPA for\nT\n, specimens with medium to high viral loads ( C values of\nT\n. values of 30), the PPA for IDNCOV was 34.3%, versus 97.1% for Xpert (290). In a\nrecent study, Stokes et al. compared IDNCOV to an LDT and showed an excellent PPA\nof 89.1% (95% CI, 82.0% to 94.1%) for IDNCOV (347). Notably, the PPA increased to\n’ 98.2% by following the manufacturer s recommendations for testing under EUA for\n# symptomatic individuals tested 7 days after symptom onset and within an hour of\ncollection using the appropriate swab (347). Overall, these studies not only demon-\nstrate that the performance characteristics of a test are dependent on numerous fac-\nﬂ ﬁ tors but also re ect the need for validations or veri\ntings and conditions where NAAT-based RDTs are applied (274, 288).\n– ﬁ (iv) Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal ampli\n– ﬁ scription loop-mediated isothermal ampli cation (RT-LAMP) is an IAT that is gaining\ninterest for potential POC applications and is also being explored for routine diagnostic\n– testing (41, 53, 54, 244, 349 351). Like RT-PCR, RT-LAMP begins with reverse transcrip-\ntion of the target RNA into cDNA by reverse transcriptase, which is done either in a\nseparate reaction or in the same tube as the LAMP reaction. The LAMP reaction can\ntake place in a single tube at 60°C to 65°C (260, 352, 353), and the process can be per-\nformed in as little as 20 to 60 min (353, 354). LAMP reactions consist of a strand dis-\nplacement DNA polymerase (e.g., Bst polymerase); a DNA template; dNTPs, typically\nfrom 4 to 6 primers; and, depending on the LAMP permutation for signal detection,\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ncation of DNA but can be used to\nc restriction endonucle-\n]) but nicks only one strand and\nthat can displace downstream DNA dur-\nexonuclease activity common\ncation with NEAR may be complex,\nﬁ city/\n– 347).\n– 347).

The NEAR ampli\nﬁ two milestones: NEAR ampli cation duplex formation and product formation. (1) The target recognition region (B\nthe reverse primer (R) binds to the complementary sequence (B) of the target DNA sense strand and is fully extended\nby the strand displacement DNA polymerase. (2) A second R primer binds to the template DNA and, during extension,\nﬁ displaces the elongated product of the\n9 (F) binds to its complementary sequence (A\nstranded nicking enzyme recognition site (N). (4) The nicking enzyme recognizes N and cleaves a single strand of DNA\nﬁ in a sequence-speci c manner at the cut site (X). (5) This releases a fragment of the R extension product.

Overall, there are four core primers that mediate all the processes\nin a LAMP reaction by recognizing six distinct regions of the target DNA through several steps. (1) After the conversion\nof the template RNA into dsDNA via reverse transcription (not shown), the LAMP reaction starts from strand invasion\nby the forward inner primer (FIP), which hybridizes through its F2 region to the F2c region of the target DNA. This\ninitiates complementary-strand synthesis using a strand displacement DNA polymerase. (2) The forward outer primer\n(FOP) (also termed the F3 primer) then hybridizes to the F3c region of the target DNA and, during extension, displaces\nthe newly elongated strand from the FIP. (3) Given that the FIP also contains an F1c sequence, the strand\ndisplacement triggered by the DNA polymerase and the FOP leads to the formation of a self-annealing loop in the 5\nend of the FIP-linked strand (regions F1 and F1c). (4) This single-stranded DNA with a stem-loop at its 5\nserves as a template for the backward inner primer (BIP), which hybridizes to the B2c region of the template DNA\nthrough its B2 sequence. (5) During elongation, the complementary strand opens the 5\nbackward outer primer (BOP) (also termed the B3 primer) hybridizes to the B3c region of the target DNA, and its\nelongation displaces the BIP-linked complementary strand. (6) The displacement of the BIP-linked strand results in self-\n9 9 hybridization on both the 5 and 3 ends, leading to two stem-loops and the formation of a dumbbell-shaped DNA. (7\nﬁ to 9) The ampli cation of the dumbbell structure with the FIP leads to a concatemer and the formation of a second\nﬁ ﬁ dumbbell structure that can be ampli ed with the BIP. Ampli\nstructure or with the annealing of primers such as the FIP and BIP. Additional loop primers (i.e., loop F [LF] and loop B\n[LB] primers) can also be used to increase the speed and sensitivity (41, 350, 351). Visualization of LAMP ampli\nﬂ is typically done by using pH-sensitive colorimetric or intercalating uorescent dyes.\nﬂ either a pH-sensitive colorimetric dye or a uorescent dye (41, 54, 244, 350, 351, 355,\nﬁ 356). The mechanism for DNA ampli cation using LAMP is summarized in Fig. 7.\nVariations of LAMP have been developed for potential POC applications with reac-\ntions that are monitored in one of three ways.

Color changes can be read by the naked eye or spectrophotometry (359,\n362). (iii) Fluorescence detection can be performed if an intercalating dye (e.g., SYBR\ngreen) is used in the LAMP reaction. When complexed with dsDNA, intercalating dyes\nﬂ can be excited to emit uorescence, which can then be captured in real time with a\norometer or a compatible thermocycler (354, 360). Alternative detection systems for\nRT-LAMP include CRISPR-Cas technology, and these are covered in a later section of\nthis review.\nFluorescence detection tends to be the most sensitive of the visualization methods,\nwhich makes the LAMP technology amenable to real-time monitoring and high-throughput\ntesting (349, 354). However, to our knowledge, no high-throughput instruments have\nadopted this technology to date. On the other hand, a commercial kit for real-time SARS-\nCoV-2 RT-LAMP (Variplex; Amplex Diagnostics, Germany) has been developed and com-\npared to real-time RT-PCR. The commercial RT-LAMP kit showed moderate agreement with\nreal-time RT-PCR, with a clinical sensitivity of 76.3% (363, 364). Given its simplicity, RT-LAMP\ntechnology has also been used to develop rapid POC products (349). Results are ready in\n30min using RapiPrep COVID-19 (MicrosensDX, England), which integrates magnetic bead-\nbased RNA extraction with LAMP technology. However, a relatively low sensitivity of 80%\nﬁ and a speci city of 73% were observed when tested on 21 nasal swabs compared to real-\ntime RT-PCR (365). The authors of that study suggested that while the sensitivity and speci-\nﬁ city were poor, the assay still had merit in some clinical applications such as algorithms\nusing repeat testing over time. Other studies that used RT-LAMP demonstrated varying per-\nformance compared to LDTs based on real-time RT-PCR for commonly used specimen types\n(357, 366). The analytical sensitivity of most RT-LAMP assays was found to be in the range of\n100 to 200 copies per reaction (360, 367), while others have reported analytical sensitivities\nof as low as 10 copies/reaction (354, 368). Altogether, this range is consistent with those of\nsome LDTs and commercial real-time RT-PCR assays (e.g., cobas SARS-CoV-2 test) (40, 278,\n368, 369). The variability in the performance of RT-LAMP assays could be attributed to differ-\nences in processing steps, specimen types, the quality of the nucleic acid extraction, LAMP\nreagents, viral targets, detection methods (manual versus automated), the methodology\nﬂ (e.g., measuring turbidity, using colorimetry, or using\nlations tested, numbers of specimens evaluated, methods used as a comparator, or other\nﬁ unde ned or uncharacterized factors like inhibition rates (244, 260\n– 370 372). Overall, RT-LAMP technology shows promise for large-scale testing (373) and POC\ntesting (260, 278, 368, 369, 374, 375), but further optimization is still required.\n(v) CRISPR-Cas technology.

First, the viral RNA is subjected to reverse\nﬁ transcription and ampli cation, e.g., in an RT-RPA reaction at 37°C to 42°C, to generate dsDNA. The dsDNA can\nbe targeted by guide RNAs (gRNAs) directly in a CRISPR-Cas12 detection system, whereas RNA detection using\nthe CRISPR-Cas13 system requires an additional T7 transcription step. When Cas12 or Cas13 is activated by the\nrecognition of gRNA, there will be cleavage of the target as well as nonspeci\noligonucleotide probes. The probes are ssDNA or ssRNA for the CRISPR-Cas12 or CRISPR-Cas13 systems,\nrespectively.

Understanding the mechanism and permutations of\nCRISPR-Cas systems led to many technological advances in genome editing (388, 389)\nand diagnostic applications such as the detection of RNA viruses (Fig. 8) (382\n387, 390, 391).\nThe use of CRISPR-Cas as a diagnostic tool was proposed by two laboratories, which\nfounded the Cas12a-based system named DETECTR (DNA endonuclease-targeted\nCRISPR trans -reporter) (392) and the Cas13-based system termed speci\nzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) (393, 394) (Fig. 8). Recently, a SHERLOCK-based\nﬁ COVID-19 test received EUA from the FDA, which is the\nHowever, many variations of CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems have emerged for the\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of clinical specimens, in both potential POC and high-\nthroughput testing formats (395). These include the SHERLOCK testing in one pot Covid test\n(STOPCovid), all-in-one dual CRISPR (AIOD-CRISPR), Cas12b-mediated detection (CDtection),\nCRISPR-assisted detection (CASdetect), and Cas13-based, rugged, equitable, scalable testing\n– (CREST) (387, 392, 395 399).\nThe composition and conditions of each stage of a CRISPR-Cas detection system can\naffect its speed and performance. For SARS-CoV-2 detection, the initial step in the CRISPR-\nCas system can be the lysis of the specimens, with or without an RNA extraction step; how-\nﬁ ever, puri ed RNA showed higher sensitivity (392, 395, 396). For example, Broughton et al.\ndemonstrated a DETECTR system that had an LoD of approximately 10 copies/\nﬁ puri ed RNA, but removing the nucleic acid extraction step decreased the LoDs to 15,000\nm and 500 copies/ l for contrived specimens consisting of spiked SARS-CoV-2 in\n$ ﬁ and 20% PBS, respectively (392). As such, the puri\nNext, the time to results for CRISPR-Cas-based methods was low compared to real-time\nRT-PCR, at 20min (395), 40min (386, 392, 397), 50min (331), 60min (387), or 70min (396),\nbut varied between methods and detection systems. All CRISPR-Cas methods described\nhere require the conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into dsDNA, which can be accomplished\nby RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, or RT-RPA. Huang et al. compared the CDC real-time RT-PCR to a\nﬂ DETECTR assay using either RT-PCR or RT-RPA with a\nlow analytical sensitivity (2 copies per sample, regardless of the method used for ampli\ntion) (331). Cas12-based CRISPR systems are typically faster than Cas13-based methods, as\nCas12 directly detects dsDNA, but the latter requires an additional transcription step to\nRNA (Fig. 8).\nThe methods used for SARS-CoV-2 result readout can also affect the speed and per-\nformance of the assays. While initially, CRISPR-Cas assays used visual readouts on commer-\nﬂ cial lateral ow assays, coupling the CRISPR-Cas technology to\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ c cleavage of dually labeled\nﬂ uorescein amidite\nﬂ ﬂ ow dipsticks, or uorometric\nuorophore (F)-quencher (Q) probes.

For example,\nJoung et al. validated a SHERLOCK-based method that returned results in 70min using the\nﬂ LFIA readout, while uorescence testing was completed in 40min (396). Guo et al. demon-\nstrated that the analytical sensitivity of CASdetec, a CRISPR-Cas12b assay based on reverse\nﬁ ﬂ transcription recombinase-aided ampli cation (RT-RAA) and\ncopies/ml, whereas the sensitivity of DETECTR and SHERLOCK ranged between 10\n5 10 copies/ml using an LFIA for detection (387). Also, CRISPR-Cas systems have been\nﬂ adapted to one-tube reactions using uorescence rather than ampli\nﬂ detection using lateral ow methods, not only to reduce processing steps but also to\n– decrease the potential for contamination (395\ntube formats, the temperature for the IAT must be compatible from the RT step to Cas-\nbased detection. Ding et al. described a one-pot reaction at 37°C combining RT-RPA and a\nCRISPR-Cas12a system and could achieve detection of 1.3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (397).\nWith the high temperatures required for RT-LAMP (55°C to 65°C), CRISPR-Cas12b systems\nhave been developed with a thermostable Cas12b protein derived from\nphilus that could maintain activity at higher temperatures (396, 401). A similar approach was\nused by Ali et al., who developed a single-tube RT-LAMP- and CRISPR-Cas12a-based system\nable to reach an analytical sensitivity (10 copies/reaction) comparable that of to the CDC\nreal-time RT-PCR (5 copies/reaction) (395). Given the many variables for CRISPR-Cas technol-\nogy, optimization of this methodology for SARS-CoV-2 and other diagnostic testing is an\nactive area of research.\nWhile the analytical performances of CRISPR-Cas technology showed some promise\nfor detecting SARS-CoV-2, validation on clinical specimens has been scarce to date.\nﬂ Hou et al. showed that an RT-RPA CRISPR-Cas13a system with\nwas able to correctly identify 52 positive specimens for SARS-CoV-2, whereas an unde-\nﬁ ned real-time RT-PCR failed to identify 5 specimens with low viral loads (402). Huang\net al. compared the CDC real-time RT-PCR to a DETECTR assay using either RT-PCR or\nﬂ RT-RPA with uorescence detection on 19 positive clinical specimens and identi\nall of them; however, 3 additional positive specimens were detected (331). These could\nrepresent false-negative results for the real-time RT-PCR or false-positive results for\nﬁ the CRISPR-Cas12 assay (i.e., speci city would be 71.4% for the latter). The LoD for the\nCRISPR-based method was 2 copies/reaction, compared to 5 copies/reaction for the\nCDC real-time RT-PCR, suggesting that CRISPR-based detection may be able to identify\nSARS-CoV-2 at lower viral loads. Broughton et al. compared the CDC real-time RT-PCR\nﬂ to an RT-LAMP DETECTR system with LFIA or\nspecimens (41 positive and 42 negative specimens) and demonstrated 95% positive\nagreement (392). Of the 21 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 identi\nreal-time RT-PCR, Ali et al., using an RT-LAMP CRISPR-Cas12 system, were able to iden-\nﬂ tify 18 (85.7%) using the uorescence readout, but weak or absent signals were noted\nwith LFIA detection (395). Overall, these data show variability in performance for\nCRISPR-based assays, ranging from 80 to 100% sensitivity.\nWhile CRISPR-based methods are showing promise for SARS-CoV-2 detection, research\ninto this technology is evolving. Recently, an RT-LAMP-based CRISPR-Cas12 system was\nﬁ ﬂ developed using an electric eld gradient on a micro\non-chip, automated separation of nucleic acids from nasopharyngeal swab samples in\n30min, followed by CRISPR-based detection (403). While further validation is required to\nﬁ fully understand the bene ts of CRISPR-Cas technology, it has much potential for applica-\ntions for POC devices or high-throughput testing platforms (331, 395).\nSARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing.\nof SARS-CoV-2 obtained from clinical specimens can help identify the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic origins, delineate transmission events, unravel clues to pathogenesis, and moni-\n– tor viral evolution over time (404 408).

For SARS-CoV-2 genomes of\nquality sequences can readily be obtained with NGS directly from clinical specimens\nusing strategies like amplicon enrichment or bait capture techniques to favor the\nsequencing of the viral targets (413). NGS involves technologies such as sequencing by\nsynthesis, sequencing by ligation, and ion semiconductor sequencing (e.g., nanopore\nsequencing), each with its own advantages and limitations (404\nprinciple of each NGS technology has been reviewed elsewhere (404\nof them are illustrated in Fig. 9.\nTo date, a single commercial kit (Illumina Inc., USA) for NGS has been approved as a\nclinical diagnostic test under FDA EUA guidelines for COVID-19, which is based on\nsequencing by synthesis (414). However, no data are available to date to describe its\nperformance, advantages, or limitations compared to commonly used detection meth-\nods like real-time RT-PCR. Also, only a limited number of studies that have explored\nthe use of NGS for SARS-CoV-2 detection for the purpose of diagnostic testing are\n– available (413, 415 417). For example, using a laboratory-developed protocol for NGS,\nBhoyar et al. compared NGS and real-time RT-PCR on 752 clinical specimens processed\nﬂ in duplicate on a single ow cell (417).

This study demonstrates the feasibility of processing 1,536 specimens in\na total of 17 h (11 h for sequencing and 6 h for analysis) (417). In another study, a low-\ncost NGS approach was shown to achieve high sensitivity for the detection of SARS-\nCoV-2 (84 genome units/ml), which is equal to or higher than those of some RT-PCR\nmethods; however, this study tested only 10 specimens (5 positive and 5 negative\nspecimens) (415).

These authors propose NGS\nas a tool for population-based surveillance rather than individualized testing for medi-\ncal decisions. While postulated to be able to achieve screening of thousands of sam-\nples on high-throughput NGS platforms, no data were provided to support the feasibil-\nity of this approach or the impact of such a high level of specimen pooling. Overall,\nsome data support the potential of NGS as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2, yet further\nﬁ analyses are required to understand its bene ts and limitations.\nDespite the potential for NGS as a diagnostic tool, the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 ge-\nnome sequencing using NGS technologies should also be recognized. For example,\nNGS technologies are challenged with specimens with low viral loads (413, 418), as\nﬁ insuf cient data or poor-quality results are obtained for subsequent analyses. Efforts to\nincrease sensitivity and quality are under way using target enrichment processes with\nNGS techniques such as multiplex PCR amplicon-based sequencing, hybrid capture-\nbased sequencing, and ultrahigh-throughput metatranscriptomic sequencing (413,\n419). Another limitation of NGS technologies is cost, which may be prohibitive for\nmany diagnostic laboratories. Furthermore, the complexity of the NGS work\nrequirement for sophisticated instrumentation and bioinformatics expertise may pose\nﬁ signi cant barriers to NGS access in many laboratories. If resources are limited, speci-\nmens could be prioritized and sent to referral laboratories to help inform public health\nresponses and global surveillance initiatives.\nWhile not routinely used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing in clinical laboratories,\ngenome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens with NGS technologies has\npaved the way for numerous applications, including investigations of disease pathoge-\nnesis, epidemiology, virus phylogenetics, SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and the impact of viral\nevolution on diagnostic testing or interventions like therapeutics and vaccines\n– (420 424).

Sanger sequencing reactions can be undertaken to analyze either of the DNA strands, but only one strand\nper reaction can be assessed. The extension of the primer annealing to the template DNA occurs in the presence of DNA\nﬂ polymerase, buffer, cofactors, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and\n(ddNTPs). The binding of the ddNTPs to the oligonucleotide strands will cease the extension, resulting in various DNA structures\nwith different lengths. Next, the extended DNAs undergo capillary gel electrophoresis in which the shorter DNA strands move\nﬂ faster, resulting in the detection of the\nﬁ ﬂ DNA fragments are resolved and nucleotide-speci c\nassembled to reveal the sequence of the template. (B) Next-generation sequencing (NGS) by synthesis. First, a library of millions\nof DNA fragments is created from the template (or enhanced by multiplex RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2). Adapters are bound to the\ntwo ends of each DNA fragment. The adapters consist of a universal primer-binding site and a unique sequence (i.e., barcode)\nﬁ ﬂ that can be hybridized to a speci c sequence on the support (e.g.,\nﬁ sequences of the adapters, bridge ampli cation is used to amplify each DNA fragment at a de\nﬂ sequencing and detection steps,\nﬂ and a polymerase, which results in the generation of\nNGS technologies are also available. (C) For example, NGS by nanopore technology is presented. After creating a library of DNA\nfragments by multiplex RT-PCR and barcoding, the library is loaded onto a membrane containing nanopores.

Next, the\nﬁ available less than a month from the rst recognition of disease reported from Wuhan,\nHubei, China (10). With rapid access to SARS-CoV-2 genome data, molecular methods\nlike real-time RT-PCR were rapidly developed at the early stages of the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic and became the method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 detection worldwide. Through re-\nmarkable efforts from public health agencies and researchers, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequen-\nces have been made available in public data repositories such as the Global Initiative on\nﬂ Sharing All In uenza Data (GISAID) ( https://www.gisaid.org/\nBiotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\ndata help provide a snapshot of global diversity and data that could be used for epidemio-\nlogical investigations. In the initial stages of the pandemic, the high diversity of SARS-CoV-2\ngenomes was attributable to multiple independent importations of SARS-CoV-2 by travel\noverseas in countries of initial virus activity, and transmission routes could be investigated\n– (418, 430 434). Following global spread and closure of international borders, sequence di-\nversity was more limited, and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes was used in outbreak\ninvestigations and became particularly useful for cases in areas of unknown community\n– transmission (418, 430 434). However, with natural evolution in the human host, or selective\npressures from the recent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or exploratory therapeutics\n(i.e., antivirals or convalescent-phase sera), there are increasing chances for SARS-CoV-2 to\n– further diversify and acquire mutations (435 439).\nThe genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 stems from naturally occurring mutations in its\ngenome, which is common at higher frequencies in RNA viruses (440). Some mutations\nmight have no impact on SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (i.e., synonymous substitutions),\nbut these may affect the performance of diagnostic tests using NAATs if they occur in the\n– target region for the assays (40, 441 443). From the various genomes of SARS-CoV-2 that\nhave been sequenced since its discovery, the M, E, and RdRp genes were shown to be fairly\nconserved compared to the high divergence observed in some regions of the S genes (420,\n– 421, 439, 444 450). Mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 could also occur from point\nmutations, insertions, deletions, or recombination events that could affect protein sequence,\nstructure, and function (i.e., nonsynonymous substitutions). Both synonymous and nonsy-\nnonymous mutations can be useful for epidemiological investigations, but it should be\nﬁ noted that nonsynonymous mutations are of signi\nin terms of disease transmissibility and severity or could help the virus escape from thera-\npeutic (i.e., convalescent-phase sera or antivirals) or preventative (i.e., vaccines) interventions.\nMutations in S are of particular concern as S glycoprotein epitopes are major targets for cur-\nrent and exploratory vaccines (35, 451, 452). Multiple SARS-CoV-2 strain variants are circulat-\ning globally, but few are variants of concern (VOCs) (439). In the United Kingdom, a novel\nvariant of SARS-CoV-2 (0B/501Y.V1, VOC 202012/01, or B.1.1.7 lineage) emerged, with an\nunusually large number of mutations. This VOC has since been reported in several countries,\nincluding Canada and the United States. It contains a number of mutations in the S gene\n(e.g., N501Y, 69/70 deletion, and P681H), and while these mutations have yet to show any\nimpact on disease severity or vaccine effectiveness, some preliminary epidemiological data\nsuggest that this variant is associated with increased transmissibility (439). In Brazil, a SARS-\nCoV-2 variant from lineage B.1.1.248 was reported, with an E484K S gene mutation associ-\nated with reduced neutralization capability by convalescent-phase plasma (453\nmutations are concerning due to potential failures of therapeutic options or prevention\nstrategies like vaccines that target similar viral protein epitopes. Furthermore, a novel VOC\nﬁ from lineage B.1.1.248 called P1 was identi ed, with 12 mutations in the S gene, including\nboth E484K and N501Y, suggesting the potential for increased transmissibility and immune\nescape (438, 439). Ongoing surveillance should be encouraged to identify novel SARS-CoV-2\nvariants and characterize the potential impacts of VOCs.\nOverall, sequence-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is important to ensure that\ndiagnostic tests accurately identify the virus and that there are no changes with novel\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nrst SARS-CoV-2 genomes were made\n) and the National Center for\n).

The design of the LFIA for antigen detection is a qualitative immunological reaction con\nsmall portable device (e.g., cassette or dipstick) that can be performed in the laboratory or a POC setting.\nﬂ Brie y, antigens in specimens (e.g., nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, and saliva) are placed in a well with a\nﬂ ﬂ sample pad, and the uid containing the antigen\nthe well where the specimen is inoculated contains a sample pad, which is in contact with the conjugate pad\nﬁ used as a support for SARS-CoV-2-speci c monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are labeled with colloidal gold\nnanoparticles (AuNPs) or other tags. If present, SARS-CoV-2 antigen (usually S or N protein) forms a complex\nwith the mAbs bound to the AuNPs, and the entire complex migrates via capillary action until it is captured by\nﬁ other SARS-CoV-2 antigen-speci c mAbs immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane (i.e., the test line). As\nantigen-antibody complexes are trapped at this location, they form a line that can be visualized by the naked\neye or with the aid of a detector. Also, mAbs-AuNPs, whether conjugated with antigens or not, continue to\nﬁ migrate until captured by an isotype-speci\nﬂ of the mAb at the control line. This ensures proper liquid\nof-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a FET-based sensor.

Unlike NAATs that rely on the detection of\nﬁ viral RNA, antigen detection is based on the identi\ntwo main antigens in SARS-CoV-2 detection assays are S and N proteins. Antigen\ndetection assays use technologies similar to those of serological methods. Like serol-\nogy, high-throughput antigen-based testing can be performed on semiautomated or\nautomated instruments using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technologies like enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs).\nHowever, most antigen detections to date have aimed for methods allowing easy-to-\nuse and rapid testing using portable devices, like LFIAs (also termed lateral\nﬂ nochromatographic assays or lateral ow assays [LFAs]).

Ag-RDTs (e.g., LFIAs) are often promoted as POC\ndevices for rapid testing and immediate management of patients in settings such as\n’ ﬁ physicians of ces or clinics; however, these tests are not always performed in these\nsettings. RDT is a more appropriate term if performed in a laboratory setting. At the\ntime of this review, few antigen-based detection assays have received EUA approval in\nthe United States and Canada, but many more applications have been submitted as\nlaboratory and/or POC tests (29, 30, 456, 457). Examples of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that\nhave received EUA for testing in laboratory or POC settings in the United States or\nCanada include technologies relying on a colorimetric LFIA with a visual readout,\nﬂ instrument-based antigen detection using a uorescence-based LFIA, a micro\nﬂ muno uorescence assay, and a chromatographic digital immunoassay (Table 2).\nWhile EUA was granted for some Ag-RDTs, at the time of this review, limited data\nhave been published on their clinical performance characteristics. The performance of\nantigen- and molecular-based POC tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 was the subject of a\nrecent Cochrane review (203), but limited data were available to be summarized (369,\n– ﬂ ﬁ 458 463). Brie y, the review summarized data from\nples. The average sensitivity of Ag-RDTs was found to be 56.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to\nﬁ 79.8%), and the average speci city was 99.5% (95% CI, 98.1% to 99.9%). In comparison,\nNAAT-based RDTs had an average sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI, 86.7% to 98.3%) and an\nﬁ ﬁ average speci city of 98.9% (95% CI, 97.3% to 99.5%). High speci\nboth molecular and antigen-based detection methods; however, low sensitivity was\nnoted for Ag-RDTs, but a high level of heterogeneity was noted between studies. This\nvariability could be explained by factors including the methods used for SARS-CoV-2\ndetection, the comparator methods during the evaluation, the patient populations\nassessed, SARS-CoV-2 prevalences, the timing of specimen collection, the specimen\ntypes used, and antigen stability during analyses.\nConsistent with the low clinical sensitivity of Ag-RDTs, the analytical sensitivity was\nﬁ de ned in some studies, which described LoDs of Ag-RDTs that were approximately\n1,000-fold lower than those of culture-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 and 10,000-fold\nlower than those of NAATs (463). Mertens et al. noted that when specimens with high\nﬁ viral loads were evaluated (de ned as specimens with real-time RT-PCR\n, 25), the sensitivity of Ag-RDTs increased to 74.8%, compared to an overall sensitivity\nof 57.6%, when all specimens were considered (459). Scohy et al. observed an overall\nsensitivity of Ag-RDTs of 30.2% (461). When specimens were further characterized by\nreal-time RT-PCR C values, the impact of the poor sensitivity of Ag-RDTs was clear.\nT\n5 , \u0001 With specimens with C values of 25 (1.8 10 copies/ml), C\nT T\n2 , \u0001 copies/ml), and C values of 35 (4.9 10\nT\nwere shown to be 100%, 70.6%, and 46.9%, respectively. Linares et al. showed that an\nAg-RDT achieved 86.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 75.0% to 97.0%) if symptomatic patients\nwith high or moderate viral loads were tested within 7 days of symptom onset (457).\nAs seen with all other SARS-CoV-2 tests, the timing of testing likely plays an important\nrole in assay performance. Recognizing the relatively poor sensitivity compared to\nNAATs but the potential role for Ag-RDTs, WHO interim guidance described situations\nwhere such tests could be considered (238). The WHO supports the use of Ag-RDTs for\nconditions such as (i) testing in areas where NAATs are not available (e.g., remote\nareas) or when the result turnaround times using NAATs are long; (ii) in outbreak inves-\ntigations, but the frequency of testing in these settings remains unclear; (iii) in areas\nwhere the prevalence is high; and (iv) for testing of asymptomatic contacts of positive\ncases.\nGiven the poor sensitivity of Ag-RDTs for detecting SARS-CoV-2, research is being\nperformed to improve sensitivity using novel sensor and biosensor technologies (464).\nSo far, a few studies have leveraged the power of electronic and electrochemical\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬂ uidic im-\nve studies, representing 943 sam-\ncity was observed for\nC values of\nT\n3 , \u0001 values of 30 (9.4 10\ncopies/ml), the sensitivities of Ag-RDTs\n31 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 32 ---\nﬁ Sa abadi Tali et al.\nReference\n585 592 587 589 591 590 588 586\nb\n/ml)\n50\nLoD (TCID\n140.6 6,309 7,570\n91.7 140 800\n88 32\nTime (min)\n15 15 10 15 30 12 15 10\nHome, H, M, W Home, H, M, W\nAuthorized\nsettings H, M, W H, M, W H, M, W H, M, W H, M, W H, M, W\nwindow (dpo)\nAuthorized\ndetection\na\nExamples of antigen tests approved for emergency use by the U.S. FDA for detection of SARS-CoV-2\nNA 12\n7 5 5 5 5 5\nSpecimen type(s)\nNS, ANS NS, NPS\nMTS ANS ANS NPS\nNS NS\nﬂ\nTarget antigen\nprotein\nN N N N N N N N\ninstrument readout LFIA, IFA, instrument LFIA, ILA, instrument LFIA, IFA, smartphone\nLFIA, visual readout LFIA, visual readout LFIA, visual readout\nuidics, IFA, ﬂ\nLFIA, instrument\nreadout readout readout readout\nMethods\nﬂ\nMicro\n(Ellume (Quidel Veritor system for rapid detection of\nBinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card home\n(Abbott Diagnostics, USA)\nDevice or assay (manufacturer) CareStart COVID-19 antigen test\nc SARS antigen FIA c\nc LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 Ag test Clip COVID rapid antigen test\nc c (Quidel Corporation, USA) Ellume COVID-19 home test QuickVue SARS antigen test\n(Luminostics Inc., USA) SARS-CoV-2 (BD, USA)\n(LumiraDx Ltd., UK)\nLimited, Australia) Corporation, USA)\n(Access Bio, USA)\n1\na 2 Flu\nTABLE 2\nc test\nﬁ\nSo\na\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ned under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet cate\nuorescence assay; ILA, immunoluminescence assay; BD, Becton, Dickinson and Company; dpo, days post-symptom onset; NS,\nﬁ\ned under the CLIA, 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet requirements to perform moderate-complexity tests; W, patient care settings operating under a CLIA certi\nThe limit of detection (LoD) of each assay is the lowest LoD reported in the instructions for use of that assay, regardless of the specimen types.\nﬁ\nnasal swab; ANS, anterior nasal (naris) swab; NPS, nasopharyngeal swab; MTS, midturbinate nasal swab; H, laboratories certi\now immunoassay; IFA, immuno\nﬁ The assay does not differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.\nrequirements to perform high-complexity tests; M, laboratories certi\nThe full list is available in reference 29.

For\nﬁ example, Seo et al. described a eld-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device\n2 \u0001 that detected SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 2.42 10\nmens, without sample pretreatment, in approximately 3 min (465). The FET sensor\nused SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to spike proteins, which were coupled\nto graphene sheets through a 1-pyrenebutyric acid N\n(PBASE) linker (Fig. 10B). With the high conductivity and other properties of graphene,\nreal-time dose-dependent detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen can be achieved down to\n1 fg/ml. While further optimization is needed to commercialize this technology, it has\nthe potential to help increase the sensitivity of antigen detection. In another study,\nMahari et al. developed an electrochemical device using a screen-printing technique.\nThey immobilized antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on screen-printed car-\nbon electrodes (SPCEs) to detect the virus and developed an integrated in-house-built\nportable device that could measure the changes in electrical conductivity upon the\nreaction between antigens and antibodies. The device was able to detect spiked SARS-\nCoV-2 antigens in saliva with an LoD of 90 fM within 10 to 30 s (466).\nWhile FETs and electrochemical sensors show promise to increase the sensitivity of\nantigen detection, the desire to achieve the highest sensitivity possible with RDTs has\nbeen the subject of recent debate (288, 299, 301, 467, 468). Some authors have pro-\nposed that with repeat testing, the chance of identifying SARS-CoV-2-infected individu-\n– als increases (288, 467 470). This may be true on a population level, where testing may\notherwise not have been performed (e.g., asymptomatic testing), and there would be\nfewer consequences if detection of the virus is missed. However, repeat testing and\nthe possibility of false-negative results in an acute-care setting pose many more chal-\nlenges, particularly when decisions have to be made at the time of or shortly after the\ntime of presentation. For existing or novel technologies, studies with more robust data\nﬁ are needed to better de ne the utility of Ag-RDTs in various settings. These should\ninclude prospective analyses that consider factors such as the timing of collection,\ntime of symptom onset, symptomatic and asymptomatic patient populations, disease\n’ prevalence, stability, and following the manufacturer\nand transport (i.e., direct testing of specimens and not using specimens in transport\nmedia).\nSerological Immunological Methods for SARS-CoV-2 Detection\nﬁ Serological assays detect antibodies speci\nﬁ rum, plasma, or whole blood (including ngerstick and heel pricks sometimes used in\nPOC testing), and the possibility of antibody detection in other body\n– liva is being explored (471 473). Given that the typical time required to detect immune\nresponses to SARS-CoV-2 is around 1 to 2 weeks, serological tests have limited utility\nfor SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in the acute stages of the illness but could have value once\n– immune responses have had time to occur (241, 474\ndetecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been developed and commercialized, and a list\nof authorized medical devices related to COVID-19 in the United States and Canada is\nregularly updated online (29, 30, 472, 479). Despite access to serological assays, the\ninterpretation of their results is further complicated in the postvaccine era for SARS-\nCoV-2, and the relevance of antibody detection must be considered in the context in\nwhich it is used and its limitations. Following a section describing serological methods,\na discussion on the relevance and possible applications is provided.\nSerological assays often use recombinant antigens to capture SARS-CoV-2-speci\nantibodies, with the N protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subu-\nnit of the S glycoprotein being the most commonly used antigens. Serological meth-\nods can target one or more immunoglobulin isotypes (i.e., IgA, IgM, or IgG) or total\nantibody, and theoretically, any of these isotypes could provide neutralizing activity\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 (480). IgM and IgG are commonly used immunoglobulins in sero-\nlogical assays for SARS-CoV-2, while IgA detection is less commonly used (479). IgA\nand IgM have shown some merits for the detection of early immune responses to\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ncopies/ml in clinical speci-\n-hydroxysuccinimide ester\ns recommendations for stability\nc to SARS-CoV-2 in blood sources like se-\nﬂ uids such as sa-\n478).

While more data are needed\nto fully understand the serological responses in different settings or patient popula-\ntions, it is clear that IgA, IgM, and IgG all have the potential to generate neutralizing\nresponses to SARS-CoV-2 (242, 481, 482).\nThe most common methods used are ELISAs in a 96-well plate format and CLIAs for\nautomated higher-throughput instruments (49, 479). LFIAs are also available to provide\nrapid results. It is unclear whether detectable antibodies in commercial serology meth-\nods are associated with immune protection, as large population-level studies and\nquantitative immunoglobulin analyses are required to assess if detection of SARS-CoV-\nﬁ 2-speci c immunoglobulins correlates with immune protection. However, studies are\nunder way to investigate the extent of neutralizing antibodies produced over time\n(242, 481, 482).\nThe performance of immunological assays remains unclear as there is a lack of a gold\nstandard for method comparison. Methods are often compared among themselves from a\nconsensus standard, but the true performance and relevance of antibody responses, and\nthe optimal testing algorithm, require further investigation (483). For now, the applications\nof serology include a role as an adjunct to molecular testing to support the identi\nof SARS-CoV-2 in a patient suspected of having COVID-19 (i.e., persistent or progressing\nsymptoms) but with the absence of testing or repeated negative (or indeterminate) results\nobtained by NAATs. It should be noted that some patients may be antibody negative at\nthe time of testing, but that does not preclude memory B cell activity or functional T cell\nresponses with subsequent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Some studies argue that immuno-\nlogical methods could also be used in seroprevalence studies to aid in ongoing outbreak\ninvestigations (to identify cases beyond the detectable window of NAATs), to determine\npast exposures of populations to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., health care workers or the general pop-\nﬁ ulation), or to assess attack rates in de ned populations or geographical areas. However,\ncorrelations to neutralizing antibody titers would be required to fully understand serologi-\ncal data, along with the impact of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other human coro-\nnaviruses as well as the impact of vaccines. High sensitivity and speci\nwith these many confounding factors, result interpretation is complicated (49, 484).

While many permutations exist, enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) can be categorized into four main types: sand-\nwich, direct, indirect, and competitive (485). For the detection of SARS-CoV-2, indirect\n– ﬁ (210, 486 489), modi ed indirect (210), and double-antigen sandwich (206) ELISAs are\nthe most commonly used methods (Fig. 11A).\nIn the indirect ELISA method, a solid support, such as wells of a 96-well microplate,\n– is coated with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens (210, 486\nﬁ plasma is added, and if present, SARS-CoV-2-speci\nbilized antigens. Following washing steps, a secondary antibody is then added that is\nﬁ speci c to the isotype targeted (i.e., anti-human IgM, anti-human IgG, or anti-human\nﬂ IgA). This secondary antibody (or conjugate) is linked to a\nﬂ ate uorescence or conjugated to an enzyme for colorimetric or chemiluminescent sig-\nnal generation following the addition of a substrate. Usually, colorimetric methods are\nused in which the optical density (OD) (i.e., absorbance) of the solution can be meas-\nured using a spectrophotometer and correlated with the concentration of the target\nantibodies. Other permutations of ELISAs are also possible, but while these techniques\nall share similarities in terms of their signal generation mechanisms, each can vary in\nperformance. Typically, the time to result for ELISAs is 1 to 5 h (41), and more recently,\nPOC applications of ELISAs for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been\nﬂ explored using micro uidics technology (490).

(B) Magnetic bead-based CLIA.\nChemiluminescence immunoassay. The chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) is an im-\nmunoassay that is commonly used in highly automated serological instruments and is\nknown for its high sensitivity compared to other serological assays (491). Similar to\nELISAs, variations of CLIAs have been applied for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibod-\nies, such as indirect (492, 493) and sandwich (239) methods.\nThe CLIA has two main differences from colorimetric ELISAs. First, the\nproduces light, which is detected by a luminometer in relative light units (RLU) rather\nthan the OD, which is an absolute value. To produce light, the conjugate uses an\nenzyme-substrate reaction such as the alkaline phosphatase (AP) and Lumigen APS-5\nsubstrates. Second, magnetic microspheres in a liquid-phase reaction rather than mul-\ntiwell plates are coated with the antigenic materials, which allows the easy separation\nof bound and unbound molecules by a magnet and faster reactions due to providing a\nlarge surface area and allowing the reactions to occur entirely in suspension (494\n(Fig. 11B). Some CLIAs have been commercialized and used on high-throughput auto-\nmatic analyzers. For example, the Liaison assay (DiaSorin, Italy) uses magnetic beads\ncoated with SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 antigens to detect IgG antibodies. This assay is ca-\npable of providing up to 170 results/h in a fully automated manner.\nFluorescent microparticle immunoassays. Recently, Norman et al. described a\nrescent nanoparticle immunoassay (FMI)-based single-molecule array assay that con-\nsisted of a mixture of four types of dye-encoded beads coupled to S, S1, S2, and N pro-\nteins and used for the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA\nantibodies (497). In this technique, an excess number of beads is utilized in comparison\nto the number of antibody molecules in the samples in a way that either zero or one\nantibody molecule binds to each bead. After the reactions occur between the coated\nbeads and the antibodies and other reagents, the beads are loaded into an array of\n216,000 femtoliter-sized wells for imaging, which allows the detection of antibodies\nwith single-molecule resolution. When tested on a set of 81 plasma samples, the tech-\nﬁ nique showed 86% sensitivity and 100% speci city for the samples during the\nﬁ week after symptom onset and 100% sensitivity and speci\nﬁ after the rst week after symptom onset (497).\nSimilarly, to facilitate the simultaneous detection of the IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes\nﬁ of SARS-CoV-2-speci c immunoglobulins, a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoas-\nsay based on Luminex technology was developed for detection on the Bioplex\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ c antibodies.

If IgM/IgG antibodies are present in the sample, they bind and form a complex\nwith the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigen conjugated with colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The complex\nis then captured in one of the test lines by anti-human IgM/IgG antibodies, resulting in a pink color due to the\naccumulation of the AuNPs.

As described in the antigen detection section above,\nﬂ lateral ow immunoassays (LFIAs) can be used as an RDT or POC test to detect antibod-\nies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood or serum samples. The most frequently used antigens\nare recombinant S or N proteins to capture total antibody or detect and sometimes dif-\nferentiate IgM and IgG antibodies (479).

Similarly, the pooled\nsensitivities for IgG detection were 64.9% (53.8% to 75.4%), 80.6% (71.9% to 87.9%), and\n93.5% (84.9% to 98.1%) for the LFIA, ELISA, and CLIA, respectively. The pooled speci\nwere fairly similar among the LFIA, ELISA, and CLIA methods, at 96.6% (93.8% to 98.4%),\n99.7% (99.0% to 100.0%), and 96.6% (84.7% to 99.5%) for IgM detection and 97.6% (96.2% to\n98.8%), 98.9% (96.7% to 99.8%), and 97.8% (62.9% to 99.9%) for IgG detection, respectively.\nOther meta-analyses and systematic reviews yielded consistent conclusions for sensitivity and\nﬁ speci city for IgM, IgG, or total antibodies (472, 502, 503).\nOne important issue affecting the diagnostic performance of serological assays is\nthe time after symptom onset when the samples are taken for serological analyses, as\nﬁ the antibody pro les change over the course of the disease. In a meta-analysis and sys-\ntematic review (49), the pooled sensitivity (95% CI) for IgM detection was low in the\nﬁ rst week after symptom onset, at 25.3% (16.3% to 31.1%), for the LFIA but increased\nto 51.8% (30.3% to 69.6%) after 2 weeks and to 69.9% (58.4% to 79.9%) after 3 weeks.\nELISA detection of IgM showed similar values for weeks 1, 2, and 3 after symptom\nonset, at 26.7% (15.6% to 35.6%), 57.6% (15.9% to 88.2%), and 78.4% (54.1% to 91.9%),\nrespectively. The CLIA followed the same trend but with higher values, at 50.3% (10.9%\nto 81.2%), 74.3% (16.1% to 99.4%), and 90.6% (51.8% to 99.4%), respectively. Next, the\npooled sensitivities for IgG at weeks 1, 2, and 3 after symptom onset were 13.4% (4.7\nto 29.6%), 50.1% (24.8% to 77.0%), and 79.7% (71.4% to 86.9%) for the LFIA; 23.7%\n(12.7% to 38.1%), 65.3% (46.3% to 79.4%), and 82.1% (76.4% to 89.0%) for the ELISA;\nand 53.2% (28.7% to 67.6%), 85.4% (48.1% to 98.1%), and 98.9% (86.9% to 100.0%) for\nthe CLIA, respectively (49).\nOverall, the performances of serology assays varied between methods and were de-\npendent on the timing of collection, and the applicability of these methods is limited\nto date. It is important to recognize that other factors such as antigens and the inher-\nent characteristics of a test or instrument used for antibody detection can also impact\nthe performance of immunological assays. Also, data summaries in recent meta-analy-\nses and systematic reviews so far have shown high levels of heterogeneity and a risk of\nbias and applicability between studies (472, 502, 503). Thus, careful attention should\nbe paid to the design of the studies, their limitations, and whether the conclusions\nﬁ derived from these evaluations are justi ed. It remains unclear whether antibodies will\nprovide durable protective responses against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections or\nwhat will be the impact of prior infection with seasonal human coronaviruses (474,\n475). It is possible that prior infection with other coronaviruses or other conditions (e.\ng., pregnancy or chronic illnesses) may cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 serology assays,\nﬁ and robust evaluation of methodologies should include speci\nrelated viruses and possible interfering substances (504, 505). The recent introduction\nof vaccine programs will further complicate the use of immunological methods as\ndiagnostic tests but may expand their use to determine whether individuals are\nimmune once exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection or following immuni-\nzation. This remains an active area of research that requires comparisons to neutraliz-\ning antibody titers and cell-mediated immunity.\nNeutralization assays and research areas of interest for serology.\nﬁ the scienti c community to help understand the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are\nfundamental in understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the interpretation of\n– SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics (506 509). There has been an extraordinary effort\nto rapidly develop serological methods in various formulations, and while some were\nlicensed under EUA in the United States and Canada, their use to make recommenda-\n’ tions on a patient s current or future susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains\nunclear (29, 30). Given the timing of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it\nis clear that serology would not be useful for diagnosis in acute phases of illness; anti-\nbodies would not be present in substantial quantities in this time frame to allow public\nhealth interventions (133). In fact, positive serology does not preclude viral shedding\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ cities\ncity analyses against\nThe efforts of\n37 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 38 ---\nﬁ Sa abadi Tali et al.\n(208, 510), and the absence of antibodies does not preclude the possibility of immu-\nnity. To date, recommendations for the use of serology include clinical research (e.g.,\nseroprevalence studies) to help inform public health strategies or policies on a popula-\ntion level (102, 133, 241). For example, seroepidemiological studies can support\nongoing outbreak investigations or retrospectively assess infection rates in certain\npopulations (133, 511). On an individual level, serology may have considerations for\nﬂ individual patients with multisystem in ammatory syndrome or in situations where\nsuspect cases repeatedly test negative by NAATs, but symptoms persist (and the tim-\nﬁ ing ts into a period of at least 2 weeks after symptom onset) (102, 133, 241). Future\nresearch is required to further understand the full value of SARS-CoV-2 serology, espe-\ncially in the context of immunization with COVID-19 vaccines.\nKey areas of research interest should include the relevance and duration of anti-\nbody-based immune responses to better understand whether antibody responses in\ncommercial tests or LDTs correlate with protective immune responses against subse-\nquent SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the magnitude and duration of these responses.\nUnderstanding this correlation can be an important function to assess immunity on an\nindividual or population level or even to qualify blood donors desiring to become\ndonors of convalescent-phase plasma that could subsequently be used in clinical trials\n(512, 513). This would require a quantitative analysis of seroconversion (detection of\nmeasurable antibodies following infection), which would not be possible with qualita-\ntive assays such as LFIAs but may be possible using semiquantitative ELISAs (where\nantibody detection relies on a signal value that is normalized to a calibrator to estab-\nlish a signal-to-cutoff [S/CO] ratio) or, ideally, using quantitative ELISAs. Quantitative\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over time could be used to demonstrate serocon-\nversion, and quantitative ELISAs have become commercially available (e.g., the liquid-\nbased double-antigen sandwich ELISA from Roche [Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S]).\nQuantitative antibody analyses, paired with a fundamental understanding of how well\nserological methods correlate with neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), may help establish a\nthreshold where populations are protected from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (known as a\ncorrelate of protection).\nﬁ The establishment of a correlate of protection\nof whether nAbs are produced, the extent to which they are produced, whether they pro-\nvide protection, and the duration of these responses and then analyzing these data in large\npopulation studies to correlate a level of nAbs that may confer protection against subse-\nﬁ quent infection (514). The quanti cation of nAbs in serum or plasma is performed using\nﬁ target- and immunoglobulin isotype-speci c neutralization assays 9like plaque reduction\nﬂ neutralization tests (PRNTs) (41, 241, 424, 515). Brie\neffectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cultured cells that would otherwise cause cy-\n– topathic effects (i.e., cell death/lysis) (41, 241, 511, 515 517).\nNonetheless, PRNTs are known to be time-consuming and laborious. To increase speci-\nmen throughput, microneutralization (MN) tests have been developed to detect nAbs to\nSARS-CoV-2 that rely on a principle similar to that of PRNTs but are performed in 96-well\nformats and without the need for semisolid overlays (511, 517). To further automate the\ndetection of nAbs, a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) can be used where patient\nsera/plasma dilutions can be assessed for their ability to reduce viral plaque formation,\nfoci, or individually infected cells using immunocolorimetric staining and visualization\nusing digital imaging (480). Despite MN, FRNTs are amenable to moderate-throughput\nﬂ testing, and alternatives have been developed using\ncence to increase sensitivity. On the other hand, MN tests and FRNTs share a challenge\nsimilar to that with PRNTs: they all rely on SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cell culture, which\nrequires laboratory facilities with higher levels of biological containment (i.e., biosafety\nlevel 3 [BSL3] in Canada or physical containment level 3 [PC3] as de\n(424). These practices are not common outside reference laboratories (241). To circumvent\nthese biosafety requirements, pseudovirus-based neutralization assays (PBNAs) have been\ndeveloped, where SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expressed on a surrogate virus backbone such\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nrst requires an in-depth understanding\ny, PRNTs rely on the ability of nAbs to\nuorescence detection and lumines-\nﬁ ned by the WHO)\n38 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 39 ---\nMethods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\nas a lentivirus, retrovirus, or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (516, 518, 519). Other alterna-\ntives include the use of a protein-based surrogate neutralization ELISA (snELISA), which is\nbased on the competition between ACE2 and nAbs for binding to recombinant antigens\n– (520 526).\nFew studies have looked at nAbs, and data on the extent and duration of nAbs over\n– the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce (508, 527\nFRNT to demonstrate that nAb binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD is detectable\nﬁ within 6 days after PCR con rmation (480). While days postonset would have better\nﬁ ﬁ de ned the antibody pro les over time, these authors showed that there is rapid iso-\ntype switching in nAbs from IgA and IgM to IgG1 and IgG3. In a limited data set from\nLong et al., it was noted that there was a decline in nAbs over time in both asymptom-\natic and symptomatic individuals (239). Similarly, Seow et al. performed a longitudinal\nstudy using sequential serum sampling and demonstrated that seroconversion was\nobserved in 95% of cases, with nAbs present 8 days after the onset of symptoms (531).\nThey also noticed that the magnitude of nAb responses depended on disease severity\nand waned over time, which was consistent with the results of others (206, 239,\n– 532 535). In some cases, nAbs persisted up to 60 days, while others approached the\nlimit of detection in this period (531). In a more recent study by Isho et al., the duration\nof antibody responses was evaluated in both serum and saliva (242). Antibodies to S\nprotein were detected in 90% of cases approximately 10 days after symptom onset,\nand longitudinal studies showed the persistence of nAbs up to 105 days. Similarly,\nﬁ nAbs (de ned using snELISAs) reached a maximum from days 30 to 45. Interestingly,\nthe sensitivities of anti-S or anti-RBD IgG in saliva were 89% and 85%, showing promise\nfor noninvasive methods for seroepidemiological studies and vaccine trials. The sensi-\ntivities of IgA, on the other hand, were 51% and 30%, and those for IgM were 57% and\n33%, respectively. It should be noted that the limited number of longitudinal studies\nﬁ seem to suggest that SARS-CoV-2-speci c antibodies decrease over a 2- or 3-month pe-\nriod; however, the longevity of humoral immunity is not yet fully understood for SARS-\nCoV-2. It is possible that memory T cells may still be able to mount effective responses\n– upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 (509, 536 538). Research into the role of cell-mediated\nimmune responses is needed to help unravel knowledge gaps for SARS-CoV-2 immune\nresponses (508, 509).\nOverall, whether derived from vaccines or natural infection, quantitative analyses of\nnAbs and establishing a correlate of protection would help inform public health and\nhealth care policies. Using neutralization assays with targets outside those used in vac-\nﬁ cines could still be of bene t to understand seroepidemiology to help better de\npopulations at risk, which would be important for vaccine trials or evaluations of novel\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2-speci c therapies like the use of hyper-IgG preparations or convalescent-\n– phase sera (520, 523, 539 541). Like any other method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, serol-\nogy research should consider antibody and cellular immune responses over time, have\na population- and individual-level testing perspective, as well as account for factors\nlike the presence or absence of symptoms, the timing from symptom onset (if present),\nthe severity of illness, host factors (e.g., age and medical comorbidities), and any collec-\ntion, transport, or processing steps that may affect the reliability of the analyte pro\nover time. Additional research is still needed to meet these goals.\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\nDespite the recent availability of vaccines, with the ongoing and rapid spread of\nSARS-CoV-2 worldwide, laboratory testing remains the cornerstone of public health\ncontainment and mitigation strategies. Given the thoroughness of the data on meth-\nﬁ odologies in the body of this review, only key\nand areas for improvement and successes are discussed below; however, a summary of\ntesting modalities is presented in Fig. 13.\nWhile compatible signs and symptoms, routine laboratory testing for biomarkers of\nhealth or disease, and diagnostic imaging have roles to play in diagnostic investigations,\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\n530).

Many technological advances have been made to detect\nSARS-CoV-2, which include NAATs to detect viral RNA and immunoassays to detect viral\nﬁ antigens or virus-speci c antibodies generated by the immune system in response to\nSARS-CoV-2. There is a growing list of commercially available methods for testing for\nSARS-CoV-2 (29, 30), and while many have been validated, the results of any test should\nbe interpreted with consideration of the context in which they are used and based on\nthe sum of all diagnostic evidence. When using any method to rule in or out SARS-CoV-2\ninfection, many factors should be considered, such as the timing and type of specimen\ncollection, the anatomical site of sampling, the method and its expected performance\ncharacteristics, host factors like compatible signs and symptoms (versus asymptomatic\ntesting), risk factors for serious outcomes, and disease prevalence in the population (82,\n– 542 544).\nNAATs like real-time RT-PCR quickly became the gold standard for diagnostic test-\ning. However, apart from those listed above, other considerations for NAATs are inher-\nent to the methodologies that are all based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. For\nexample, it is important to recognize that the performance of any molecular diagnostic\nﬂ method can be in uenced by sequence mismatches between the method\nand the different genome permutations of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and var-\niants. A possible strategy to reduce the chance of false-negative results that could\noccur by target mismatches is the simultaneous use of molecular methods targeting\nmore than one gene, as failure to detect a signal in one target gene may not preclude\ndetection in another (40, 164, 443). Alternative strategies could include the use of\ndegenerate primers and probes, a strategy used with other RNA viruses that are prone\nto mutation (443, 545, 546). Ongoing molecular surveillance using sequencing technol-\nogies should also be encouraged to monitor changes in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequen-\nces and COVID-19 epidemiology, particularly with an emphasis on variants linked to\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ncation of COVID-19.

With human resource strains and supply chain\nshortages, providing NAATs during the pandemic was challenged by factors such as\nPPE, human resource strains for sample collection and testing, swabs, and test reagent\navailability for NAATs. From a clinical perspective, alternatives to NP swabs traditionally\nused for respiratory specimens were rapidly validated, as was the use of various trans-\nport media or swab-free options that are amenable to self-collection (e.g., saliva or sa-\nline gargles). The application of these specimens in the laboratory added complexity\nﬂ to the laboratory work ow and required rapid validations to ensure compatibility with\nnew or existing instrumentation.\nTo help meet capacity demands in the laboratory, laboratories were faced with the\nneed to rapidly procure large quantities of supplies, acquire instrumentation, train\nadditional personnel, and validate specimens, reagents, and equipment. Despite this,\nsupply chain challenges and rapid escalation of testing demands led to the need for\nresource-sparing strategies for NAATs, including specimen pooling and extraction-free\nNAAT protocols. Such strategies come at the cost of a relatively reduced sensitivity,\nwhich is associated with the potential risk of missing detection of SARS-CoV-2 in speci-\nmens with low viral loads. It could be argued that small reductions in sensitivity may\nhave little impact on the detection of most cases. Remnant SARS-CoV-2 at the outset\nof illness can persist for weeks and is unlikely to represent a period of communicability.\nOn the other hand, missing detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen with a low viral\nload at the early stages of illness may potentially lead to further virus spread. These\ntesting strategies should be carefully considered prior to implementation.\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2-speci c NAATs evolved over time to facilitate testing and streamline the lab-\nﬂ oratory work ow. For example, to further streamline testing for respiratory viruses, some\nmethods have now been multiplexed to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, in\nB viruses, and other respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In nonpandemic\nﬂ years, in uenza and other viral etiologies of respiratory tract infections represented a leading\ncause of death in North America, particularly among hospitalized patients with community-\n– acquired pneumonia (547 553). Interestingly, while cocirculation and coinfection with other\nrespiratory viruses were reported, there was little activity for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory\nviruses (554). It is unclear whether public health interventions (e.g., travel restrictions, social\ndistancing, handwashing, or PPE like masks) resulted in this decline or whether other factors\ninadvertently contributed to biases in data, such as fewer individuals seeking routine medi-\nﬂ cal attention or the lack of testing for in uenza and other respiratory viruses due to competi-\n– tion for resources used for SARS-CoV-2 testing (554\nusing multiplex technologies could provide an option for syndromic testing that would\nensure surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and other important respiratory viruses like in\nrus and appropriate interventions as needed (e.g., antivirals).\nThe public and political pressure for laboratory testing evolved with public health\nindications, and laboratory testing continues to guide public health policies as restric-\ntions ease or escalate throughout the ongoing pandemic (47, 484). One area of signi\ncant advancement in NAAT methodologies includes the use of automation to minimize\nhands-on processing time and increase specimen throughput.

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scale\nand demand for laboratory testing have been unmatched by other pandemics.\nConcerns over SARS-CoV-2 prompted the testing of both symptomatic and asymptom-\natic individuals, in the context of public health case contact tracing and surveillance\npurposes. This includes testing for SARS-CoV-2 in both health care settings where\npatients are at increased risk (e.g., hospitals and long-term-care facilities) and situations\nwhere testing would not otherwise have been performed (i.e., professional sports\nteams, public events, prior to or after travel, and various workplaces).

Also, rapid validation of\nlaboratory tests and collection devices to meet regulatory requirements despite avail-\nability through EUA from regulatory bodies as well as the development of an informa-\ntion technology infrastructure to continuously improve the laboratory information\nﬂ management system (LIMS) in the laboratory testing work\nnear-real-time laboratory data to various stakeholders from local to national levels and\ndissemination to the public through various media formats are of great value. While\ndigitization was not an absolute requirement, the interconnectivity of data ensured\ntransparency and up-to-date information as decision support tools for recommenda-\n– tions, policies, and guidelines (53, 559 561). All of these have been identi\nWHO as key factors to control the COVID-19 pandemic (562).\nTo further enhance testing capacity and provide access for rapid SARS-CoV-2 test-\ning options, both antigen- and NAAT-based RDTs have been developed and are now\nreadily available (29, 30). These can support rapid laboratory and POC applications,\nscreening of large patient populations, or rapid deployment for assessments of target\nareas. NAAT-based RDTs rely on real-time RT-PCR or isothermal ampli\n(e.g., RT-RPA, RT-LAMP, and NEAR) and, like antigen-based RDTs, can provide rapid\nresults without complex instrumentation. The ease of use of these portable devices\nallows access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in settings that may have been prohibitive for\ntraditional laboratory NAATs. Throughout the literature, the main limitation noted for\nRDTs is their reduced sensitivity compared to traditional NAATs, but the evaluations of\nﬂ their performance do not always re ect conditions in which the RDT was licensed\nunder EUA, and the comparator method and distribution of expected specimen results\ncan have a large impact on assay performance (274, 290, 341, 342, 457). Even if these\nissues are not considered, and all SARS-CoV-2 detection results were considered of\nvalue, a possible strategy to mitigate the relatively reduced sensitivity of antigen- or\nNAAT-based RDTs is to increase the frequency of testing in the patient population over\ntime, to increase the chances of identifying individuals who fall in a period of high viral\nshedding (which would be less likely to be impacted by reduced sensitivity) (288, 299,\n301, 467, 468). On the other hand, the implementation of such strategies has chal-\nlenges of its own due to the limited scalability of RDTs, and the balance between sensi-\ntivity and testing frequency to achieve optimal SARS-CoV-2 detection in the target\nﬁ population would need to be de ned (288). Moreover, if, for example, EUA de\nuse of RDTs as within 7 days of symptom onset, this excluded their use for testing of\nasymptomatic individuals. While much development is ongoing to enhance existing\nRDT technologies or explore novel methodologies (53, 465, 466, 563\ncan effectively be used in practice is the subject of ongoing debate, and further\nresearch is needed to understand what setting they would best be of bene\nFor serology, currently available commercial assays are based on ELISAs, CLIAs, and\nLFIAs and are designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, the performance of\nserological assays varies across the different technologies, the timing from disease\nonset, and comparator methods. Clinical validation of serological methods is ongoing,\nbut recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews so far have shown high levels of het-\nerogeneity and a risk of bias and applicability (472, 502, 503). For example, with the\ntime required to mount anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during seroconversion (or possibly\nthe absence of seroconversion in mild disease), serology has limited value in identify-\ning SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of illness. Serology has value for seroepidemiologi-\ncal studies to help with ongoing outbreak investigations, can aid in the diagnosis of\nsuspect cases for whom NAATs were persistently negative or not performed, or can\nhelp with conditions in children and adolescents like multisystem in\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\now and dissemination of\nﬁ ed by the\nﬁ cation methods\nﬁ ned the\n– 565), how RDTs\nﬁ t.\nﬂ ammatory\n42 cmr.asm.org\n\n--- Page 43 ---\nMethods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\nsyndrome where NAAT results may be negative (102, 133, 241, 566\nresearch is needed to expand the knowledge on the use of immunological methods,\nparticularly in the context of the recent availability of vaccines.\nKey areas of research interest for serology should include the relevance, magnitude,\nand duration of protective antibody responses, particularly faced with a population\nthat may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or other human coronaviruses or vacci-\nnated against SARS-CoV-2. Detection of different antibody isotypes is possible with\ncommercial or laboratory-developed serological assays, and recent quantitative meth-\nods have now become commercially available; however, much is yet to be learned on\nhow these methods correlate with protective immune responses. Establishing corre-\nlates of protection will require longitudinal studies with parallel assessments of quanti-\ntative levels of nAbs and cell-mediated immune responses. Various neutralization\nassays have been established to assess and quantify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in\nserum or plasma (e.g., PRNTs, MN tests, or surrogate assays like PBNAs and snELISAs),\nbut data are scarce when it comes to longitudinal studies undertaken to fully under-\nstand the differences or similarities between commercial assays for the qualitative\ndetection of antibodies, quantitative antibody analyses over time, and relevance to the\nlevel and duration of protective nAb titers. While the longevity of humoral immunity is\nnot yet fully understood for SARS-CoV-2, some data suggest that antibody levels\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 wane over 3 months. Notwithstanding these observations, it is\npossible that memory T cells may still be able to mount effective responses upon reex-\nposure to SARS-CoV-2, and the role of cell-mediated immune responses may also pro-\nﬁ vide additional bene ts (508, 509). Further research is needed, as a greater understand-\ning of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental in making informed\nrecommendations for the use of immunological methods to assess current or future\nprotection against the virus, to determine meaningful endpoints in the development\nand evaluation of effective vaccines, or to assess effectiveness following immunization\nwith existing vaccines.\nOverall, methods based on RNA, antigen, or antibody detection as well as diagnos-\ntic imaging all have a place in our response to SARS-CoV-2, but ongoing research is\ncrucial to further optimize and apply all these testing modalities. The emergence of\nthe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a wave of innovative and creative thinking, and\nmore and more creative methods and platforms are being introduced with goals to\nincrease the armamentarium of diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection. An\nunderstanding of the advantages and limitations of each method used for SARS-CoV-2\ndetection as well as the development of novel methods will help us unravel the\nunknowns of disease pathogenesis, epidemiology, and transmissibility and help us de-\nvelop interventions to mitigate and contain its spread. There will always be a need for\nlaboratory testing and collaboration between clinical laboratories, public health, infec-\ntion prevention and control, and many others who contribute to the efforts to contain\nthe spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, it is also recognized that maintaining large\ninvestments in the rapid deployment of translational research and such a high degree\nof laboratory testing for COVID-19 will likely not be sustainable from an economic per-\nﬁ spective, and justi cations for such investments will be more dif\nﬁ signi cantly with vaccines. However, the lessons learned from SARS-CoV-2 could\npotentially be used in the preparedness for potential future pandemic threats, thus\nstrengthening global health and surveillance systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nﬁ ﬁ This research received no speci c nancial support.

Ef cient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as rapid and large-scale\ntesting plays a pivotal role in patient management and decelerating disease spread. This\npaper reviews current technologies used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as\nwell as advances made for molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care\ntesting, including recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance\nof the timing and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as dis-\nease prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of the various\nmethodologies are presented, along with their application span and known performance\ncharacteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers are also covered, with an\nemphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or monitoring disease severity or complica-\ntions. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is rapidly evolving, this review highlights topics of\ninterest that have occurred during the pandemic and the lessons learned throughout.\nExploring a broad armamentarium of techniques for detecting SARS-CoV-2 will ensure\ncontinued diagnostic support for clinicians, public health, and infection prevention\nand control for this pandemic and provide advice for future pandemic preparedness.\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, NAAT, PCR, serology, antigen, KEYWORDS\ncoronavirus, biomarkers, next-generation sequencing\nINTRODUCTION\nW ﬁ hile coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not the\ncentury (1), it has generated unprecedented global concern and responses.\nCOVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is\nthought to have emerged from a zoonotic source (2) and spread rapidly in humans\nthrough respiratory droplets and contact. There is some concern for airborne transmission,\nbut the role of this transmission route outside the potential aerosolizing procedures in\n– health care settings is unclear (3 5). With an estimated reproductive number,\n– of between 1.4 and 5.6, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread worldwide (6\n– reported in December 2019 (10 12), there have been over 106 million con\n2.3 million deaths reported worldwide (as of 9 February 2021) (13).\nFrom a disease manifestation perspective, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptom-\nﬂ atic (14), and COVID-19 spans from a mild in\ncomplications (15, 16). SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the respiratory tract, resulting in\npneumonia, but also can affect gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, or cardiovascular sys-\ntems. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 include cutaneous manifestations such as a\nKawasaki-like disease in children and ophthalmic/gustatory dysfunction (i.e., anosmia\nand ageusia, which are the loss of smell and taste, respectively), which may have been\n– underestimated in initial reports (17 20).\nDespite numerous therapeutic options being explored (e.g., convalescent-phase\nplasma), no large-scale treatments are available. Public health interventions have\nevolved over time to limit viral spread (Fig. 1) and have included the use of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) like masks, handwashing, and containment measures such\nas city lockdowns, travel restrictions, and physical distancing (21\n’ strategies have been essential to reduce the virus\nadverse socioeconomic impacts, and adherence to these prevention strategies is challeng-\ning to sustain (22). Currently, cases of COVID-19 have declined following a\nwave in some areas, whereas other areas are experiencing subsequent waves of activity.\nFortunately, many vaccine candidates are under development and undergoing regulatory\n– approval processes (31 35). Recently, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been the\ncensed for use and are rapidly being administered as supplies are provided (28, 36).\nHowever, given the time required for adequate immunization coverage in the population\n– at large, subsequent pandemic waves are anticipated (31, 37\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ rmed cases and\nrst pandemic of the 21st\nR naught ( R ),\n0\nﬁ 9).

While common in diagnostic labo-\nratories worldwide, many laboratories remain faced with supply chain shortages for\nreal-time RT-PCR reagents and consumables, all while being asked to increase testing\ncapacity. As such, delays were common for test results, prompting the exploration of\nalternative testing options such as specimen pooling or laboratory testing using meth-\nods other than RT-PCR. Methods that could enhance testing capacity, streamline test-\ning (i.e., automation), or provide more rapid results in easy-to-use formats that are\namenable to point-of-care (POC) applications without complex instrumentation (e.g.,\n– isothermal technologies) were all desired (41\nfrom the academic to industry partners, and this research is ongoing to develop testing\nalternatives or complements to existing technologies.\nWhile recent reviews have been published on the management of SARS-CoV-2\n– (41, 47 55), recent advancements in novel diagnostic methods justify the need for\na more comprehensive synthesis of the current literature. In this review,\nbiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are described in order to fully understand\nthe molecular and immunological methods for its detection. Following a brief discussion\non the COVID-19 manifestations, compatible signs and symptoms, and disease biomarkers,\ndiagnostic imaging techniques are described in relation to COVID-19 lower respiratory\ntract involvement, including applications such as monitoring disease severity, the progres-\nsion of the illness, or complications.

Overall, this review expands our knowledge of current and exploratory avenues\nfor detecting SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.\nIt should be noted that some of the references used in this review were preprints\nthat have not been peer reviewed, and recognizing that data on the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, some details on testing options and\nguidelines may no longer be recent and should thus be reviewed in the context of recent\nﬁ ndings and recommendations.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed that\nSARS-CoV-2 has a diameter in the range of 60 to 140 nm, and its morphology was con-\nsistent with those of other members of the Coronaviridae\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus, and on the genetic level, it\nshares 96%, 80%, and 50% sequence identities with bat coronavirus (RaTG13), SARS-\nCoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively (11,\n56). Based on these analyses, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses\nnamed the virus SARS-CoV-2, which was formerly referred to as the 2019 novel corona-\nvirus (2019-nCoV) or human coronavirus 2019 (hCoV-19) (25).\nOur understanding of SARS-CoV-2 structure and function has been largely derived\nfrom research on SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 has\na single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of between 26 and 35 kb, encoding\napproximately 27 proteins with similarity to proteins of known functions, while others\nare unclear/unknown or putative (Fig. 2B) (21, 37, 53, 57, 58). The\n9 ; frame (ORF1a/b) on the 5 end of the viral genome occupies\n’ nome and produces two polyproteins (pp s), pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins\nare processed by the viral proteases into 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp\nproteins are collectively involved in polyprotein processing, viral RNA replication, and\nmRNA synthesis (53, 57). The remaining proteins, including the structural and acces-\nsory proteins, are expressed from several nested subgenomic mRNAs produced\nthrough a process known as discontinuous transcription by the viral RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase (RdRp).\nThe structural proteins include the small envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) pro-\ntein (also known as the matrix protein), nucleocapsid (N) protein, hemagglutinin-ester-\nase (HE) protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein (Fig. 2A) (57, 59). The E and M proteins are\nprimarily involved in viral assembly, budding, and virion morphogenesis (60\nthe N protein complexes with the viral genomic RNA to generate the nucleocapsid\n(63).

The S protein\ntrimers contain a stable stalk separated from the globular heads by three\nhinges, allowing for orientation freedom to interact with host cell receptors (65). The S1 subu-\nnit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell surface, whereas the S2 subunit contains\na structural loop responsible for fusion events between the viral and host cell membranes,\nresulting in the release of the viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm (66, 67). Of note, along\nwith engaging the ACE2 host cell receptor, the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 is engaged\nfor S protein priming, and this cofactor has been investigated as a possible antiviral target\nusing viral entry inhibitors (68, 69).\nOverall, having knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis can help in understanding\ndisease manifestations and help guide the development of molecular and immunolog-\nﬁ ical tools for the identi cation of this virus.\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF COVID-19\nThe spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection can vary from asymptomatic infection to life-\nthreatening complications of COVID-19 (37). Using modeling, it was estimated that\nover 59% of transmissions arise from asymptomatic individuals, with 35% from individ-\nuals in presymptomatic stages of infection and 24% from individuals who never de-\nvelop symptoms (70). These estimates are concerning but emphasize the need for the\nwide use of vaccines and maintaining key public health interventions like mask wear-\ning, hand hygiene, and social distancing.\nIn most symptomatic cases, COVID-19 presents as a mild to moderate upper respira-\ntory illness, with signs and symptoms compatible with those of other respiratory\nviruses (71). As such, the diagnostic accuracy of any individual sign or symptom is very\npoor, and neither the presence nor the absence of any sign or symptom can be used\nto rule in or out COVID-19 (71). With the possibility of other pathogens that could pres-\nﬁ ent like SARS-CoV-2 infection, case de nitions based on clinical presentation are not\nﬁ ﬁ suf ciently speci c but can help support the investigation of suspect COVID-19 cases.\nOn the other hand, given that the list of possible presentations and atypical manifesta-\ntions of COVID-19 could mirror those of other diseases, identifying the etiology of ill-\nness as SARS-CoV-2 requires laboratory testing.\nIn a recent Cochrane review, a summary of 16 studies (7,706 patients) was presented\n(71). Only six of the possible signs and symptoms of COVID-19 had sensitivities of\nand results were highly variable between studies and settings. The most common signs\nand symptoms (and their performances) are summarized as follows: cough (with sensitiv-\nﬁ ity and speci city from 43 to 71% and 14 to 54%, respectively), sore throat (5 to 71% and\n55 to 80%), fever (7 to 91% and 16% to 94%), musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., arthralgias\nor myalgias) (19 to 86% and 45 to 91%), fatigue (10 to 57% and 60 to 94%), and head-\nache (3 to 71% and 78 to 98%) (71). It was noted that possible confounders were pres-\nent, and the high heterogeneity between data suggested that signs and symptoms are\nvariable between individuals (71). Other less common clinical presentations have been\ndocumented, including alterations in smell or taste (i.e., anosmia or dysgeusia) as well as\n– – neurological or cutaneous manifestations (17 19, 72\nearly stages of the pandemic, some of these symptoms may have been missed or under-\nreported, but knowledge on possible clinical presentations of COVID-19 have evolved\nover time.\nIn some cases of COVID-19, progression to lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., pneu-\nmonia) can occur and may require hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) support,\nand mechanical ventilation, and complications can arise, which include acute respira-\n– tory distress, multiorgan dysfunction, and death (71, 77\ncomes and deaths are more common with increasing age or in individuals with under-\nlying medical comorbidities such as respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease,\n– and diabetes (78 80).

In terms of recovery, the me-\ndian duration of hospital stay is 10 to 14 days, and resolution generally occurs within 2\nto 3 weeks (85).

The most common symptoms were fatigue\n(53.1%), dyspnea (43.4%), joint pain (27.3%), and chest pain (21.7%).\nOverall, while some signs or symptoms may be compatible with COVID-19, none\nﬁ ﬁ are speci c, and laboratory testing is required to con\nare required to help identify the frequency of atypical clinical presentations, and addi-\ntional studies looking at known clinical presentations of COVID-19 should consider\npossible confounders such as the possibility of other etiologies, host factors (e.g.,\ncomorbidities), disease severity, and the times from infection and symptom onset.\nBIOMARKERS FOR COVID-19 AND ROUTINE LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS\nﬁ Apart from laboratory tests speci c for detecting SARS-CoV-2 discussed throughout\nthis review, routine laboratory testing spanning hematological, biochemical, and\n’ chemical markers is used to assess a patient s health or identify possible clues to a dis-\n– ease state (87 90). Such routine laboratory workup of individuals is used to re\nmedical differential diagnosis, thereby supporting or refuting potential causes of the\nclinical presentation based on typical outcomes of these investigations for a de\ndisease. Many of these investigations can evolve through the clinical course of illness,\nand additional testing can be ordered by physicians based on the clinical presentation.\nThese can include tests such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, markers for in\ntory conditions (C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin [PCT], or interleukin 6 [IL-6]),\ntests for anticoagulation, and indicators of tissue damage (alanine aminotransferase\n[ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatine ki-\nnase [CK]). While biomarkers for COVID-19 have been the subject of much investigation\nduring the current pandemic, none of these tests are sensitive or speci\nIn a Cochrane review analyzing 67 laboratory tests from 21 studies encompassing\n14,126 COVID-19 cases and 56,585 non-COVID-19 cases, only three markers showed\nﬁ . sensitivity and speci city values of 50%: a decrease in the lymphocyte count and\nﬂ increases in the in ammatory markers CRP and IL-6 (90). Overall, no individual bio-\nmarker can be used reliably to rule COVID-19 in or out, and laboratory testing should\nbe performed. However, it should be noted that some laboratory markers have value\nfor patient management as they can help assess the severity of the disease or progres-\nsion of the illness or even act as risk factors for death. In the most recent Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance documents for clinicians caring for\npatients with COVID-19, a summary of important laboratory tests is described, with\nﬁ lymphopenia being the most common laboratory\nCOVID-19 (87). Laboratory markers associated with increased illness severity include\nlymphopenia, neutropenia, and elevated serum ALT, AST, LDH, CRP, and ferritin (87,\nﬂ 88). Patients with critical illness have high plasma levels of in\nelevated levels of d-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with an increased\nrisk of death.\nOf note, this section is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all biomarkers\nused in routine or exploratory investigations for COVID-19. We recognize the availabil-\nity of guidelines for clinicians caring for patients with suspected or con\nwith SARS-CoV-2 (87, 88) as well as the expertise of medical staff in ordering laboratory\ntests to help guide evolving differential diagnoses throughout the clinical course of ill-\nness. However, this section also recognizes the ongoing efforts of researchers who are\ndedicated to understanding the role of existing or novel biomarkers. Overall, no labora-\ntory marker to date is diagnostic for COVID-19, but they have value in patient manage-\nment over time, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection status.

Testing of specimens from the lower respiratory\nﬂ tract (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] uid) is possible using nucleic acid ampli\ntion tests (NAATs) like RT-PCR, but obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens is not\n– always possible (104 107). Along with laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging can com-\nplement investigations of COVID-19 to assess the involvement of disease in the lower\nrespiratory tract or other anatomical sites. Diagnostic imaging techniques include chest\nradiography (or chest X ray [CXR]), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography-CT (PET/CT)\n– (108 116). Among these, CT scans are the most frequently used methods for diagnosis\n– of lower tract involvement or follow-up of COVID-19 cases (110\ncross-sectional images at different angles, thereby providing a three-dimensional (3D)\nlook at the targeted anatomy. Chest CT scan images can be assembled and assessed\nby radiologists to check for possible abnormalities suggestive of lower tract disease\nsuch as viral pneumonia (53, 112, 117). Typical features of a chest CT image in COVID-\n19 are ground-glass or reticular opacities (GGOs) with or without consolidations that\npresent bilaterally, peripherally, or in posterior distributions (113).\nThe utility of diagnostic imaging for routine screening for COVID-19 has been a sub-\nject of debate and has not been recommended by most radiology societies (113, 114,\n– 118 121). On the other hand, due to the shortage of RT-PCR supplies during the early\ndays of the pandemic and the possibility of false-negative RT-PCR results from sam-\npling the upper respiratory tract, some hospitals in the Hubei province of China\nincluded CT scans in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (53, 117, 122, 123). While\ndiagnostic imaging techniques like CT have merits to help assess lower respiratory\ntract disease involvement, to monitor disease progression, or to investigate other com-\nplications of COVID-19, it should be noted that diagnostic imaging methods are less\nsensitive than sampling the lower respiratory tract and testing using molecular meth-\nﬁ ods, and speci city is low, given that typical features of COVID-19 are common to other\n– – respiratory viruses or illnesses (113 116, 124\nscans in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suggested an increased sensitivity of CT over real-\ntime RT-PCR, but others have suggested explanations for the disparities between RT-\nPCR results and diagnostic imaging assessments, including poor sampling techniques,\ndifferences in the performances of testing methods, the anatomical site of RT-PCR test-\ning (upper versus lower tract), and disease prevalence (111, 124, 126, 129\n. sensitivities (i.e., 90%) have been reported for CT scans in high-prevalence popula-\n, tions, while low sensitivities ( 60%) were reported in studies with low-prevalence pop-\n– – ﬁ ulations (112 114, 118 121, 123).

In other words, approximately 80% of individuals would have\nreceived a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the absence of disease. As such, the use of diag-\nnostic imaging techniques should be accompanied by careful consideration of factors\nsuch as disease prevalence in the study population, severity of the illness, performance\nand context of the methods used, differences in radiologist opinions, and possible con-\n– – – founding diagnoses (112 114, 118 121, 123, 126, 132\nalso important to recognize that diagnostic imaging is a useful tool for patient man-\nﬁ agement with or without a con rmed etiology through laboratory testing, as it can be\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ ca-\n112).

AI-based methods can be used in diagnostic\nimaging to help recognize abnormal features in images and classify them into de\ncategories, thus increasing accuracy, standardization, and speed of analyses by radiol-\n– ogists (50, 109, 142 146). AI approaches can be categorized into three main groups:\napproaches that analyze CT scan images, methods based on X ray, and those that real-\nize diagnosis through jointly analyzing CT scan and X-ray images (147\nﬁ based applications have shown bene ts for diagnostic imaging methodologies (50,\n109, 145, 146), more clinical investigations are needed to evaluate their possible incor-\nporation into routine procedures for investigations of suspected cases of COVID-19,\nﬁ and laboratory testing is required to con rm the disease etiology. Furthermore, acquir-\ning a reliable AI-based system requires access to a comprehensive training data set\nthat includes all variations of COVID-19 as well as other lung diseases; providing such\nﬁ an all-inclusive data set is dif cult and labor-intensive.\nLABORATORY METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF SARS-CoV-2\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 can be performed using molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2\nRNA, which is now widely available. Immunodiagnostic methods for identifying viral\nantigens and serology to recognize an immune response to the virus are also available.\nThe following sections describe the commonly used and potential methods for the lab-\noratory detection of SARS-CoV-2, with important consideration for factors like speci-\nmen type and timing of specimen collection.\nSpecimen Types\nPrior to describing methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, it should be recognized that\naccurate detection of any infectious disease requires adequate specimen collection at\nthe anatomical site of infection, at a time when the pathogen of interest should be\n– present (152 154). While the virus has been detected in a variety of specimen types\n– using molecular methods (26, 96, 155 161), few have been widely adopted due to\nunreliable detection or a lack of sensitivity. The use of blood, serum, or plasma for\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2-speci c serology and other immunodiagnostic tests is discussed in later\nsections of this review.\nFor respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, specimens collected from the upper respira-\nﬂ tory tract using a ocked nasopharyngeal (NP) swab that is placed in universal or viral\ntransport medium (UTM or VTM, respectively) are the gold standards (162\ntrast to other swabs (e.g., cotton swabs on wooden sticks), specimen collection using\nﬂ ﬁ ocked NP swabs that are coated with multilength\nof respiratory viruses and bacteria, and the UTM or VTM allows a stable medium for\ntransport to the laboratory (133). Other than NP swab specimens, alternative speci-\nmens and collection methods have been validated and gained interest, including the\nuse of nasal midturbinate swabs, sampling of the anterior nares (Na), oropharyngeal\n(OP) swabs, or washes/aspirates from the nasopharynx, nose, or throat (96, 97, 154,\n– 165 172). Specimen combinations can also be used. For example, paired collection\nusing an OP swab along with sampling of the anterior nares was shown to be equiva-\nlent to NP swab collection for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, and different options are\navailable for OP/Na collection (133, 154, 167, 168, 173). It is worth mentioning that dur-\ning the COVID-19 pandemic, procurement of NP swabs and UTM (or VTM) was chal-\nlenged by global supply chain shortages. Several groups have developed and validated\nthe possibility of using 3D-printed swabs as alternatives to commercial NP or nasal\nswabs, but while some have been clinically validated for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA,\nfurther investigations are required for their applicability in SARS-CoV-2 antigen detec-\n– tion (174 178). For media used for swab transport to laboratories, other than the typi-\ncal UTM or VTM, alternatives have been investigated for use for SARS-CoV-2 testing,\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ncial intelligence (AI) (also\nﬁ ned\n– 151).

When lower tract infection\nis suspected through clinical presentation or with the aid of diagnostic imaging, speci-\nﬂ mens such as BAL uid, endotracheal secretions, or sputum should be considered (55,\n– 95 102, 180).\nRecently, the use of noninvasive collection methods like saliva and throat gargles\nhas gained much interest, as these samples are amenable to self-collection and have\n– the potential for large-scale population-based surveillance (181\nies have demonstrated that the performance of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\nwas comparable to that of NP or nasal swab collections (183, 184, 187\nchallenged the performance of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (191). The variability in\nsaliva collection or differences in the patient populations tested might explain these\ninconsistencies, but further analyses are required (191, 192). Also, although not used\nroutinely in many laboratories, detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool is possible in the\npresence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms (193). The possibility of culturing\nSARS-CoV-2 from stool opens discussions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral trans-\nmission and human health or ecological risks (194, 195) and also opens the opportu-\nnity for research into community-based surveillance in low-prevalence settings using\nwastewater (193, 196).\nIn postmortem examinations, the extent of investigations will be dependent on sev-\neral factors, but NP swabs, swabs from the lungs, and tissue samples can be used for\n– diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 (197 200). Specimens in 10% buffered neutral saline\nﬁ ﬁ or formalin- xed paraf n-embedded (FFPE) specimens commonly used for histopatho-\nlogical examinations can also be used, but these pose challenges for NAATs like real-\ntime RT-PCR as RNA can be degraded by formalin, and sensitivity for the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR could be compromised (201). The CDC recom-\nmends that these media be used in limited settings (197). Immunohistochemical (IHC)\nand in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have now been\ndeveloped, but limited data are available on their performance (202).\nTiming of Specimen Collection\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2 has been identi ed in various clinical specimen types (26, 96, 154\nbut the timing of detection differs between methods and the specimen types collected\nfor testing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected early in the presymptomatic stage of the\ndisease and later on, even after recovery. However, the timing of specimen collection\nis critical, as testing too early or too late following exposure can potentially lead to\nfalse-negative results (203). It was shown that real-time RT-PCR false-negative rates\ncould be minimized by testing 2 to 3 days after symptom onset, with an average time\n– of symptom onset of 5 days postexposure (204\nfor individuals with an initial negative test result but for whom there is a high level of\nclinical suspicion (134). Of note, viral shedding studies are often performed using RNA\ndetection alone and less often in combination with virus culture; however, the absence\nof cultivable virus does not preclude the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and\nlaboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular methods does not imply infec-\n– tious virus (208, 211 217). For the purpose of this section, viral shedding is described\nin the context of RNA detection without implying the potential for viral transmission.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract ranged from 8\nto 38.4 days for mild cases of COVID-19 and spanned between 6 and 26.9 days for mod-\nerate to severe illness (221). In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the pooled esti-\nmates of the mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset in\nmild adult cases were 12.1 days (95% CI, 10.1 to 14.1 days) in the upper respiratory\ntract and 24.1 days (95% CI, 10.0 to 38.2 days) in the lower respiratory tract.

In cases of moderate to severe adult disease, maximal\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the upper respiratory tract occurred on day 8, at 4.6\n8 \u0001 copies/ml, and on day 11, at approximately 3.5 10\ntract (221). Regarding the differences in viral loads and durations of shedding between\nsymptomatic and asymptomatic patients, the literature is inconsistent. Some publications\nobserved little to no difference in viral loads between the two groups (222\nﬁ others suggested signi cantly higher viral loads in symptomatic patients (224). Whether\nthese differences are attributed to differences in disease severity, variations in the perform-\nances of methods used, or host factors remains to be determined.\nAs highlighted above, the median duration of viral shedding is variable between\nindividuals and likely dependent on disease severity and several host factors such as age,\nimmunocompromising conditions, or medical comorbidities (208, 212\nWhile most individuals with mild disease clear the virus within 10 to 20days, in some cases\nwith severe COVID-19, the duration of shedding can be prolonged (217, 230). The longest\ndurations of viral RNA shedding reported to date were 83 and 111days after symptom\nonset (231, 232); however, the persistence of RNA suggestive of low viral loads may be of\nﬁ little clinical signi cance, as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not necessarily imply\n– – infectivity (170, 208, 212 220, 227 229). Moreover, many factors can affect the detection\nof SARS-CoV-2 RNA, such as the quality of sample collection, transport, and variables in\nlaboratory processing; RNA positivity can be intermittent and inaccurate at the later stages\nof illness (233). Therefore, the CDC recommends that the discontinuation of transmission-\nﬁ based precautions for patients with con rmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be based on\nthe resolution of symptoms and not based on testing (230). While some countries have\nsimilar recommendations for discharge from quarantine, there is some heterogeneity in\napproaches, and these often vary based on the severity of illness and the presence or ab-\nsence of symptoms (234).\nWhile not used routinely in many laboratories, detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from\nstool is possible in the presence or absence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (193, 235).\nHowever, only 1% of patients had detectable RNA in their stool in the absence of positive re-\nspiratory specimens (193, 235). For some patients, viral shedding in stool can occur for a lon-\nger period than in the respiratory samples and could help diagnose infection if upper and\nlower respiratory tract specimens are negative but there is a high suspicion of disease\n– (156 160, 193, 236). Of individuals who test positive with GI specimens, the median duration\nof RNA shedding in the GI tract is 12.5days following negative respiratory tract specimens\n(193, 235). Less frequently, shedding in stool can be prolonged and has been documented\nup to 70days after symptom onset or 33days following clearance from the respiratory tract\n(236, 237). As for respiratory tract specimens, RNA detection does not necessarily imply that\ninfectious virions are produced, but SARS-CoV-2 has been cultured from stool specimens in\nsome studies (236, 237).\nLike molecular methods, antigen testing can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins\nin the acute stages of the disease following the incubation period in upper respiratory\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ ed by\n8 \u0001 10 copies/\n8 10 copies/ml on day\n9 \u0001 10\ncopies/ml, in the lower respiratory\n– 226), while\n– – 217, 227 229).\n10 cmr.asm.org",

Antigen detection\nﬂ using immunoassays like lateral ow rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is often less sensitive\nthan molecular methods (203, 238), but these tests can detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen reliably\nwhen the viral load is high in the clinical specimens (i.e., typically from 1 to 3days before\nthe onset of symptoms to 5 to 7days after symptom onset), whereas the likelihood of\nSARS-CoV-2 detection decreases in the second week after symptom onset (238).\nIn contrast to RNA and antigen detection, immunological responses take longer to\nappear, with antibodies typically beginning to appear 6 days after symptom onset, as\nﬁ viral RNA levels begin to decline (207). Typically, the\nblood is immunoglobulin M (IgM), followed by immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, con-\ncomitant increases of the IgM and IgG immunoglobulin classes as well as IgG\nconversion have also been observed (239). Few data are also available for immuno-\nglobulin A (IgA) detection, a marker of mucosal immune responses, but it is evident\nthat both IgA and IgM decline rapidly over the course of infection (240). The median\nseroconversion times for total antibody, IgM, and IgG were 9, 10, and 12 days after\nsymptom onset (or 15, 18, and 20 days after exposure), respectively (240). It is unclear\nhow long IgG responses last or whether they confer protection against subsequent\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfection (241). The longest study on the antibody dynamics tracked IgG\nup to 115 days after symptom onset in sera and saliva (242). Immune responses may\nvary depending on disease severity and host factors such as immunocompromising\nconditions or other medical comorbidities, and the value of immune responses will be\ndependent on the ability to provide neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) or cellular immunity\ncapable of viral clearance. The applications and limitations of serology and other\nimmunodiagnostics are discussed in more detail in later sections of this paper.\nSpecimen Preprocessing Requirements\nWhile detection of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens can be performed using\nRNA or antigen detection, they sometimes require a preprocessing step like heat lysis\nor inactivation using guanidinium salts before nucleic acid extraction and ampli\nor testing, to ensure safe handling conditions, depending on local biosafety risk assess-\nments (133, 154, 173, 180). Specimen types such as sputum may require mucolytic\nagents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), N -acetyl- L\nreduce specimen viscosity prior to testing (243). Other preprocessing steps would\ninclude centrifugation for specimens like stool (236), PK digests for tissues (e.g., lung\nbiopsy specimens), and specimen aliquoting into compatible tubes for testing (if test-\ning from primary specimen containers is not possible). With any manipulation of the\nprimary specimen (i.e., preprocessing steps), careful consideration should be under-\ntaken to ensure that there are no potential impacts on downstream testing (e.g., RNA\nor antigen stability). Of note, some preprocessing steps, like specimen lysis, can be\ndone in conjunction with nucleic acid extraction using automated instrumentation\n(discussed below in the real-time RT-PCR section of this review).\nOverall, the choice of the specimen and timing of collection are crucial for the accu-\nrate detection of SARS-CoV-2, as are factors such as the severity of illness.

Both lysis/extraction and RT-PCR ampli\nperformed sequentially through manual processing on individual instruments, or the\nentire process can be automated.\nﬁ (i) Specimen lysis and RNA puri cation. To release viral RNA from host cells and vi-\nrions, specimen lysis can be performed using physical (e.g., heat, sonication, or homog-\nenization), chemical (e.g., organic solvents, detergents, chelating agents, or chaotropic\nagents), or enzymatic (e.g., proteases) methods (54, 243, 248, 249). Lysis steps based\non enzymatic digestion (e.g., proteinase K digestion) are common for nucleic acid\nextraction in clinical laboratories. Following specimen lysis, extraction of viral RNA is\nperformed to remove cellular debris and contaminants that could potentially inhibit\n– the RT-PCR and purify the nucleic acids (250\nsilica-coated magnetic microbeads are used to capture nucleic acids, which can be\nsequentially transferred into different wash solutions by a robotic pipetting instrument\n– ﬁ with a magnetic head (248 252). The ef ciencies of several extraction methods have\nbeen compared for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and the results favor commercial kits over\nmanual methods like organic extractions containing guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-\nchloroform (253).\nIt should be noted that while nucleic acid extraction is essential to achieve optimal\nsensitivity in molecular assays, recent studies have described extraction-free protocols\nfor molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the potential bottleneck of extrac-\ntion if the supply of extraction reagents or consumables is limited (or to provide\n– options for low-income environments) (254\nextraction step to remove PCR inhibitors in clinical specimens, there is a notable reduc-\ntion in sensitivity, but the extent is dependent on the method and target used for\nSARS-CoV-2 detection, the type and duration of the lysis/inactivation method (heat or\nchemical), the input volume, the specimen type, the transport media, and the viral\n– load in the specimen (253, 257, 263 265). For example, the sensitivity of a 60-min heat\ninactivation alone reached 100% for specimens with moderate to high viral loads\n(threshold cycle [ C ] values of between 20 and 30) but declined to 54% in specimens\nT\n. with C values of 30 (264).\nT\nﬁ ﬁ (ii) Target ampli cation and detection.

(1) During reverse transcription, reverse transcriptase (RT) creates a cDNA\nfrom the viral RNA template, with the aid of the reverse primer (or random oligonucleotides). The RNase H\nactivity of the RT digests the initial RNA template. (2) The DNA polymerase activity of RT (or of the\npolymerase) completes the second DNA strand guided by the forward primer and cDNA. (3) The newly formed\ndouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is used as a template for the PCR portion of the assay. At the annealing stage,\nﬁ the reverse primer binds to the sense strand of dsDNA in a sequence-speci\nand a dually labeled probe bind to the antisense strand of the DNA. In this stage, the\non the probe is masked by the quencher (Q). During the extension step, the DNA polymerase extends the\nforward primer and, in the process, hydrolyzes the probe, resulting in the release of the\nﬂ following excitation, uorescence emission can be captured by the real-time thermocycler. With each round of\nﬁ PCR ampli cation, the dsDNA amplicon is multiplied by a 2-fold factor, with a proportional increase in the\nﬂ ﬁ overall uorescence signal.

Despite limited access to control materials early in the\npandemic, LeBlanc et al. assessed the analytical performances of various LDTs and\ncommercial RT-PCR assays and found that most of them had a high sensitivity with\nsimilar limits of detection (LoDs) in the range of 3.4 to 4.5 log\n10\nﬁ copies/reaction) (40). Similar pro ciency testing across laboratories has been per-\nﬁ formed by others, demonstrating high sensitivity and speci\n– methods and instruments (280 282).\nIn the initial stages of the pandemic, dual- or multigene detection strategies were\nﬁ adopted for real-time RT-PCRs to ensure assay speci\ngressed and the disease prevalence increased, some laboratories implemented single-\nﬂ target detection of SARS-CoV-2 in LDTs to streamline the work\ncommercial methods continue to rely on detection using two or more targets (283). In\nﬁ duplex or multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays, if the identi\nered a positive result, sensitivity would be enhanced compared to the requirement of\nat least two targets to be positive for a SARS-CoV-2 result to be released as such (40).\nHowever, this strategy comes at the risk of decreasing the speci\nincreasing the false-positivity rate (40). Regardless of the approach for testing, each tar-\nﬁ get should have a validated range of values that de\nminate result as well as conditions that would trigger an invalid result (e.g., processing\nor quality failures) (40, 284). C values can be used in real-time RT-PCR to de\nT\ncutoffs, and indeterminate (or equivocal) results arise for values falling between the\ncutoff values of negative results and the reproducible C\nT\nis sometimes termed the diagnostic gray zone for result interpretation (40, 285).\nLow C values suggest that more viral RNA was present in the specimen, whereas\nT\nhigh C values represent specimens with lower virus burdens, as more cycles were\nT\nrequired to amplify the viral target.

While methodologies may have differed between studies\nto explain these differences (e.g., fresh versus frozen specimens), it should be noted\nthat the infectious dose required for human infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown\nﬂ and in uenced by many biological and environmental variables. Given the variability\nthat can occur in specimen collection, transport, and processing, there are no biologi-\ncal correlates accurately linking C values to infectivity or the potential for transmission.\nT\nDetectable virus by NAATs does not imply infectious virus.

LDTs and commercial assays for moderate- to high-throughput\ntesting for SARS-CoV-2 require relatively expensive equipment and experienced per-\nsonnel to obtain accurate and robust data, and the turnaround time for results can\ntake several hours. Real-time RT-PCR assays are constantly being improved to increase\nspecimen throughput, provide rapid specimen turnaround times, reduce the hands-on\ntime, and facilitate result interpretation and reporting. Automated high-throughput\ninstruments are capable of performing over 1,000 tests daily, with performance charac-\nteristics greater than or equivalent to those of LDTs (167, 168, 251, 289\nﬁ cally require separate nucleic acid extraction and ampli\nesses can occur simultaneously with high-throughput instruments, along with full\ntraceability, and results can be directly reported through interfacing with the labora-\nﬁ tory information system. One of the rst high-throughput instruments with a commer-\ncially available SARS-CoV-2 detection assay was the cobas 6800 instrument (Roche\nMolecular Systems, USA), but other highly automated instruments relying on NAAT\ntechnology are now available, with similar performances, testing capacities, and work-\nﬂ ﬁ ow bene ts. These include the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay on the m2000\ninstrument (Abbott Molecular, USA), the Hologic Panther SARS-CoV-2 assay (Hologic,\nUSA), the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 assay (NeuMoDx Molecular, USA), and BD Max\n– reagents (Becton, Dickinson, USA) (296 302). Advances have also been made for LDTs\nfor SARS-CoV-2 testing using semiautomated robotics to streamline specimen process-\nﬁ ing, nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR setup and ampli\ninterfacing for data reporting (295). LDTs for SARS-CoV-2 have also been adapted for\nother instruments, such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). In ddPCR, water-oil emulsions\nare used to partition nucleic acid samples into thousands of nanoliter-sized droplets,\nﬁ – and PCR ampli cation is carried out within each droplet (303\nformance of ddPCR has been shown to be equivalent to or slightly more sensitive than\nLDT comparators, but limited data are available for its use in clinical laboratories\n– (303 306).\n(v) Specimen pooling. Regardless of the NAAT used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, man-\nﬁ ufacturers of nucleic acid puri cation kits or RT-PCR reagents and consumables have\nbeen challenged with the rapid increase in testing demands that came with the global\nspread of SARS-CoV-2. With challenges to meet testing resources and limitations in the\nsupply chain, research into alternative testing strategies has been explored (254). A\npossible strategy to increase testing capacity and gain laboratory ef\ntesting (i.e., specimen pooling) (307). While many pooling permutations are possible,\nits simplest application involves combining patient samples before testing and retest-\nﬁ ing individual specimens following the identi cation of a positive pool (308\noptimal number of specimens within pools (i.e., pool depth) varies with disease preva-\nlence and assay performance (307, 311, 312). While larger pool depths may achieve\nﬁ higher ef ciency, particularly for high-throughput instruments, the trade-off is the\naccompanying reduced sensitivity, with the potential generation of false-negative\nresults (307). When prevalence is low, typically only a subset of specimens with low vi-\nral loads pass undetected, while the testing capacity is increased and the cost of test-\ning is reduced (307, 311, 312). In settings of high disease prevalence, the merits of\npooling are lost given the high number of pools that need to be resolved.

For lower-throughput analyzers like NAAT-based RDTs,\npooling can also be considered (312). Overall, while thorough validation and careful\nconsideration of potential impacts of pooling should be considered before implemen-\ntation on any instrument, pooling can offer an opportunity for clinical laboratories to\nincrease testing capacity, reduce costs, and mitigate the supply chain limitations of lab-\noratory testing (311).\n(vi) RT-PCR-based rapid diagnostic tests. Unlike high-throughput automated instru-\nments that are focused on large specimen volumes, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), as their\nname implies, are focused on speed. While this is acceptable for routine testing, RDTs have\nbeen developed to provide rapid results with easy-to-use testing, with minimal hands-on\nﬁ processing steps to facilitate training and testing. The\nthat obtained EUA from the FDA and Canada was the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on\nthe Cepheid GeneXpert platform (Cepheid Inc., USA), which provides results in about\n, 45min, with a 5-min hands-on specimen processing time (27). This NAAT-based RDT\nshowed analytical and clinical performance characteristics often greater than those of\n– LDTs and other commercial NAATs (99, 167, 168, 290\nnoted that while Xpert Xpress is often referred to as a point-of-care (POC) test, this testing\nis not typically performed at the time and place of patient assessment and is more com-\nmonly performed in a laboratory setting; therefore, the term RDT would be more appropri-\nate. The most current version of the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assay is multiplexed with in\nA and B viruses as well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can present with similar\nrespiratory symptoms (315). More highly multiplexed assays like BioFire Respiratory Panel\n2.1 with SARS-CoV-2 (BioFire Diagnostics, USA) are also available, which allow a syndromic\napproach with the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 and several other respiratory\nviruses (316, 317). While syndromic testing is also being developed for larger instruments,\nsuch assays on RDTs are particularly useful for remote communities or resource-limited set-\ntings or for testing of populations where rapid diagnosis would be of bene\nadmitted to the ICU).\nOther devices with a focus on potential POC applications have integrated RT-PCR\nﬂ with rapid (5- to 30-min) technologies such as digital micro\n– readouts, and portable instruments (318 325). All these assays have the advantage of\nspeed and simplicity but are prone to limitations such as low sensitivity, low specimen\nthroughput, and minimal scalability (288). For developing countries or other resource-\nlimited settings where instrumentation is lacking, other cost-sparing testing alterna-\ntives are being explored. Arumugam et al. demonstrated a proof of principle of an RT-\nPCR that could be conducted in 12 min using a setup consisting of thin-walled PCR\ntubes, sous vide immersion heaters/circulators, and an endpoint readout performed\nwith a light-emitting diode (LED) gel-viewing box (326). Such creative and innovative\nsolutions from industry and academic settings help meet the global needs for SARS-\nCoV-2 laboratory testing, besides other NAATs rapidly being developed and validated.\nﬁ Isothermal ampli cation technologies. In efforts to develop portable and rapid\ndiagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, NAATs other than RT-PCR have been investigated.\nﬁ Isothermal ampli cation technologies (IATs) are conducted at a constant temperature,\neliminating the need for expensive equipment such as thermocyclers. The principles\nbehind IATs rely on thermal or enzymatic denaturation of nucleic acids, followed by\nﬁ nucleic acid ampli cation reactions, and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (244).\nIsothermal NAAT technologies include transcription-mediated ampli\nnicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR), loop-mediated isothermal ampli\nﬁ (LAMP), recombinase polymerase ampli cation (RPA), and systems using clustered regu-\n– larly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)\nsystems. While most IAT methods have been applied to DNA, they can often be adapted\nﬁ to RNA ampli cation by adding an RT step (e.g., RT-LAMP and RT-RPA) (244, 271, 327,\nﬁ 328).

(1) The reaction is initiated by the binding of a recombinase (e.g., T4 UvsX) and a\nloading factor (e.g., T4 UvsY) to each of the forward and reverse primers. (2) These recombinase/\nloading factor/oligonucleotide complexes search for homologous sequences in dsDNA, formed in the\nRT reaction from viral RNA (not depicted). (3) Once sequence homology is found, the recombinase\ncomplex invades the duplex DNA, forming a structure called a D-loop in an ATP-dependent reaction,\nwhere there is the unwinding of dsDNA and binding of the primer to its complementary sequence.\nAccess to the primer-binding sequence is possible due to the stabilization of the opposite strand by\nSSBs (e.g., T4 gp32). Subsequently, the recombinase and loading factor disassemble and are released\nto initiate other rounds of target recognition. (4) Following the binding of the forward and reverse\n9 primers, these primers are extended at their 3 ends using a strand displacement DNA polymerase (e.\ng., Bsu ), and during the elongation process, there is a further separation of the two strands.

RT-RPA uses a DNA poly-\nmerase to extend forward and reverse primers and make copies of each DNA strand (like\nPCR). However, to unwind and copy the DNA strands generated from reverse transcription,\nRPA requires the ATP-dependent targeting activity of a recombinase complex as well as the\npolymerase activity of a strand displacement DNA polymerase (e.g., Bsu ) (329, 330).\nWhile the mechanisms for RT-RPA are relatively simple, the reaction components\nare fairly complex. Single-tube RT-RPA reactions include forward and reverse primers,\ncore enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase, recombinase, recombinase loading factor,\nand a strand displacement DNA polymerase), proteins like single-stranded binding pro-\ntein (SSB), and a number of ancillary components such as deoxynucleoside triphos-\nphates (dNTPs), salts, buffers, cofactors, crowding agents, ATP, and an enzymatic\n18 July 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20 cmr.asm.org",

Once\n2 1 added, magnesium (Mg ) initiates the RPA reaction. Fortunately, various kits are now\ncommercially available for RPA (e.g., TwistDx, United Kingdom), with variations for the\nprobe used in the detection step (329). For example, the TwistAmp exonuclease (exo)\nﬂ probes are used for uorescence detection through a mechanism involving exonucle-\nﬂ ase III, whereas a detection system designed for a lateral\nbe incorporated using endonuclease IV (nfo) probes (329). Alternative\nﬂ technologies have also been used, such as\n(FRET) probes or CRISPR-Cas technology (271, 327).\nUnlike real-time RT-PCR, RT-RPA does not require sophisticated instrumentation like\nthermocyclers, thereby simplifying the testing process. The ease of use of this isother-\nmal technology makes RT-RPA an attractive candidate for point-of-care molecular tests.\nRT-RPA technology has been applied to the detection of other RNA viruses like Ebola\nvirus (329); however, to date, data presenting its use for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\nﬁ are scarce (271, 327, 331). Kim et al. used a modi\nCoV-2 and achieved a sensitivity of approximately 4 copies/reaction in a 10-min reac-\nﬂ tion that used a lateral ow immunoassay (LFIA) readout. Their RT-RPA correctly identi-\nﬁ ed all 18 contrived specimens generated by spiking heat-inactivated virus into NP\nswabs or saliva (327). A second publication by Xia and Chen described another modi-\nﬁ ed single-tube version of RT-RPA introduced by GenDx called reverse transcription-\nﬁ enzymatic recombinase ampli cation (RT-ERA) as well as the whole-course encapsu-\nﬁ lated procedure for exponential ampli cation from RNA (WEPEAR) protocol (271). The\nWEPEAR protocol contains all the reaction components necessary for RT-ERA, except\n2 ’ 1 the activator Mg , which is loaded into the microtube\nﬁ the tube can be spun and mixed to initiate the modi\nﬂ probes for a uorescence output or nfo probes for LFIA-based detection, the WEPEAR\nprotocol achieved high sensitivity in the range of a single copy per reaction.\nUnfortunately, this method was attempted on only a single clinical specimen and\nwould require further validation. Other applications of the RT-RPA for the detection of\nSARS-CoV-2 involve the use of CRISPR-Cas technology, which is covered in a later sec-\n“ ﬁ tion [see Isothermal ampli cation technologies.

Transcription-mediated ampli\nﬁ (TMA) is an IAT that ampli es RNA from an RNA template (41, 332\nnology has been applied to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics on high-throughput analyzers\n(296, 322, 335, 336). Figure 5 illustrates the principle of TMA.\nThe Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay is performed on the Hologic Panther instrument, a\nhighly automated instrument capable of processing over 1,000 specimens daily (41).\nﬁ Its principle combines a puri cation step using target capture, TMA for RNA ampli\ntion, and chemiluminescent probes for RNA detection. In the target capture step,\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA is isolated from specimens using magnetic microparticles coupled to\nﬁ oligomers containing sequences complementary to speci\nmolecules as well as polydeoxyadenosine residues. By modifying the temperature, se-\nquential hybridization can occur between the RNA target and the sequence-speci\nportion of the capture oligomers, and a hybridization step then occurs between the\npolydeoxyadenosine region of the capture oligomer and the polydeoxythymidine\nsequence that is covalently bound to the magnetic microparticles (337). After the puri-\nﬁ cation step, TMA reactions occur, while detection is achieved through the hybridiza-\nﬁ tion of sequence-speci c single-stranded oligonucleotide probes labeled with acridin-\nium ester. A reagent is applied to generate a chemiluminescence signal that can\ndistinguish between free and bound probes. A luminometer captures the resulting\nlight emitted from bound probes, expressed as relative light units (RLU).\nThe Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay has only recently been authorized by the FDA\nand Health Canada, but data on its performance are scarce. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay\nshowed higher analytical sensitivity than some LDTs using real-time RT-PCR, and the per-\nformance against other high-throughput analyzers was equivalent (296, 335, 336).\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\now assay (LFA) output can\nﬂ uorescence\nuorescence resonance energy transfer\ned version of RT-RPA to detect SARS-\ns lid.

All false-negative results corresponded to specimens for which\nvalues were between 35 and 40, suggesting low viral loads.

However, they also noted that the PPA varied with viral loads. When speci-\nmens were categorized by C values, both INDCOV and Xpert showed 100% PPA for\nT\n, specimens with medium to high viral loads ( C values of\nT\n. values of 30), the PPA for IDNCOV was 34.3%, versus 97.1% for Xpert (290). In a\nrecent study, Stokes et al. compared IDNCOV to an LDT and showed an excellent PPA\nof 89.1% (95% CI, 82.0% to 94.1%) for IDNCOV (347). Notably, the PPA increased to\n’ 98.2% by following the manufacturer s recommendations for testing under EUA for\n# symptomatic individuals tested 7 days after symptom onset and within an hour of\ncollection using the appropriate swab (347). Overall, these studies not only demon-\nstrate that the performance characteristics of a test are dependent on numerous fac-\nﬂ ﬁ tors but also re ect the need for validations or veri\ntings and conditions where NAAT-based RDTs are applied (274, 288).\n– ﬁ (iv) Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal ampli\n– ﬁ scription loop-mediated isothermal ampli cation (RT-LAMP) is an IAT that is gaining\ninterest for potential POC applications and is also being explored for routine diagnostic\n– testing (41, 53, 54, 244, 349 351). Like RT-PCR, RT-LAMP begins with reverse transcrip-\ntion of the target RNA into cDNA by reverse transcriptase, which is done either in a\nseparate reaction or in the same tube as the LAMP reaction. The LAMP reaction can\ntake place in a single tube at 60°C to 65°C (260, 352, 353), and the process can be per-\nformed in as little as 20 to 60 min (353, 354).

Overall, there are four core primers that mediate all the processes\nin a LAMP reaction by recognizing six distinct regions of the target DNA through several steps. (1) After the conversion\nof the template RNA into dsDNA via reverse transcription (not shown), the LAMP reaction starts from strand invasion\nby the forward inner primer (FIP), which hybridizes through its F2 region to the F2c region of the target DNA. This\ninitiates complementary-strand synthesis using a strand displacement DNA polymerase. (2) The forward outer primer\n(FOP) (also termed the F3 primer) then hybridizes to the F3c region of the target DNA and, during extension, displaces\nthe newly elongated strand from the FIP. (3) Given that the FIP also contains an F1c sequence, the strand\ndisplacement triggered by the DNA polymerase and the FOP leads to the formation of a self-annealing loop in the 5\nend of the FIP-linked strand (regions F1 and F1c).

Color changes can be read by the naked eye or spectrophotometry (359,\n362). (iii) Fluorescence detection can be performed if an intercalating dye (e.g., SYBR\ngreen) is used in the LAMP reaction. When complexed with dsDNA, intercalating dyes\nﬂ can be excited to emit uorescence, which can then be captured in real time with a\norometer or a compatible thermocycler (354, 360). Alternative detection systems for\nRT-LAMP include CRISPR-Cas technology, and these are covered in a later section of\nthis review.\nFluorescence detection tends to be the most sensitive of the visualization methods,\nwhich makes the LAMP technology amenable to real-time monitoring and high-throughput\ntesting (349, 354). However, to our knowledge, no high-throughput instruments have\nadopted this technology to date. On the other hand, a commercial kit for real-time SARS-\nCoV-2 RT-LAMP (Variplex; Amplex Diagnostics, Germany) has been developed and com-\npared to real-time RT-PCR. The commercial RT-LAMP kit showed moderate agreement with\nreal-time RT-PCR, with a clinical sensitivity of 76.3% (363, 364). Given its simplicity, RT-LAMP\ntechnology has also been used to develop rapid POC products (349). Results are ready in\n30min using RapiPrep COVID-19 (MicrosensDX, England), which integrates magnetic bead-\nbased RNA extraction with LAMP technology. However, a relatively low sensitivity of 80%\nﬁ and a speci city of 73% were observed when tested on 21 nasal swabs compared to real-\ntime RT-PCR (365). The authors of that study suggested that while the sensitivity and speci-\nﬁ city were poor, the assay still had merit in some clinical applications such as algorithms\nusing repeat testing over time. Other studies that used RT-LAMP demonstrated varying per-\nformance compared to LDTs based on real-time RT-PCR for commonly used specimen types\n(357, 366). The analytical sensitivity of most RT-LAMP assays was found to be in the range of\n100 to 200 copies per reaction (360, 367), while others have reported analytical sensitivities\nof as low as 10 copies/reaction (354, 368). Altogether, this range is consistent with those of\nsome LDTs and commercial real-time RT-PCR assays (e.g., cobas SARS-CoV-2 test) (40, 278,\n368, 369). The variability in the performance of RT-LAMP assays could be attributed to differ-\nences in processing steps, specimen types, the quality of the nucleic acid extraction, LAMP\nreagents, viral targets, detection methods (manual versus automated), the methodology\nﬂ (e.g., measuring turbidity, using colorimetry, or using\nlations tested, numbers of specimens evaluated, methods used as a comparator, or other\nﬁ unde ned or uncharacterized factors like inhibition rates (244, 260\n– 370 372).

Recently, a SHERLOCK-based\nﬁ COVID-19 test received EUA from the FDA, which is the\nHowever, many variations of CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems have emerged for the\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of clinical specimens, in both potential POC and high-\nthroughput testing formats (395). These include the SHERLOCK testing in one pot Covid test\n(STOPCovid), all-in-one dual CRISPR (AIOD-CRISPR), Cas12b-mediated detection (CDtection),\nCRISPR-assisted detection (CASdetect), and Cas13-based, rugged, equitable, scalable testing\n– (CREST) (387, 392, 395 399).\nThe composition and conditions of each stage of a CRISPR-Cas detection system can\naffect its speed and performance. For SARS-CoV-2 detection, the initial step in the CRISPR-\nCas system can be the lysis of the specimens, with or without an RNA extraction step; how-\nﬁ ever, puri ed RNA showed higher sensitivity (392, 395, 396). For example, Broughton et al.\ndemonstrated a DETECTR system that had an LoD of approximately 10 copies/\nﬁ puri ed RNA, but removing the nucleic acid extraction step decreased the LoDs to 15,000\nm and 500 copies/ l for contrived specimens consisting of spiked SARS-CoV-2 in\n$ ﬁ and 20% PBS, respectively (392). As such, the puri\nNext, the time to results for CRISPR-Cas-based methods was low compared to real-time\nRT-PCR, at 20min (395), 40min (386, 392, 397), 50min (331), 60min (387), or 70min (396),\nbut varied between methods and detection systems. All CRISPR-Cas methods described\nhere require the conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into dsDNA, which can be accomplished\nby RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, or RT-RPA. Huang et al. compared the CDC real-time RT-PCR to a\nﬂ DETECTR assay using either RT-PCR or RT-RPA with a\nlow analytical sensitivity (2 copies per sample, regardless of the method used for ampli\ntion) (331).

Also, CRISPR-Cas systems have been\nﬂ adapted to one-tube reactions using uorescence rather than ampli\nﬂ detection using lateral ow methods, not only to reduce processing steps but also to\n– decrease the potential for contamination (395\ntube formats, the temperature for the IAT must be compatible from the RT step to Cas-\nbased detection. Ding et al. described a one-pot reaction at 37°C combining RT-RPA and a\nCRISPR-Cas12a system and could achieve detection of 1.3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (397).\nWith the high temperatures required for RT-LAMP (55°C to 65°C), CRISPR-Cas12b systems\nhave been developed with a thermostable Cas12b protein derived from\nphilus that could maintain activity at higher temperatures (396, 401). A similar approach was\nused by Ali et al., who developed a single-tube RT-LAMP- and CRISPR-Cas12a-based system\nable to reach an analytical sensitivity (10 copies/reaction) comparable that of to the CDC\nreal-time RT-PCR (5 copies/reaction) (395). Given the many variables for CRISPR-Cas technol-\nogy, optimization of this methodology for SARS-CoV-2 and other diagnostic testing is an\nactive area of research.\nWhile the analytical performances of CRISPR-Cas technology showed some promise\nfor detecting SARS-CoV-2, validation on clinical specimens has been scarce to date.\nﬂ Hou et al. showed that an RT-RPA CRISPR-Cas13a system with\nwas able to correctly identify 52 positive specimens for SARS-CoV-2, whereas an unde-\nﬁ ned real-time RT-PCR failed to identify 5 specimens with low viral loads (402). Huang\net al. compared the CDC real-time RT-PCR to a DETECTR assay using either RT-PCR or\nﬂ RT-RPA with uorescence detection on 19 positive clinical specimens and identi\nall of them; however, 3 additional positive specimens were detected (331). These could\nrepresent false-negative results for the real-time RT-PCR or false-positive results for\nﬁ the CRISPR-Cas12 assay (i.e., speci city would be 71.4% for the latter). The LoD for the\nCRISPR-based method was 2 copies/reaction, compared to 5 copies/reaction for the\nCDC real-time RT-PCR, suggesting that CRISPR-based detection may be able to identify\nSARS-CoV-2 at lower viral loads. Broughton et al. compared the CDC real-time RT-PCR\nﬂ to an RT-LAMP DETECTR system with LFIA or\nspecimens (41 positive and 42 negative specimens) and demonstrated 95% positive\nagreement (392). Of the 21 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 identi\nreal-time RT-PCR, Ali et al., using an RT-LAMP CRISPR-Cas12 system, were able to iden-\nﬂ tify 18 (85.7%) using the uorescence readout, but weak or absent signals were noted\nwith LFIA detection (395). Overall, these data show variability in performance for\nCRISPR-based assays, ranging from 80 to 100% sensitivity.\nWhile CRISPR-based methods are showing promise for SARS-CoV-2 detection, research\ninto this technology is evolving. Recently, an RT-LAMP-based CRISPR-Cas12 system was\nﬁ ﬂ developed using an electric eld gradient on a micro\non-chip, automated separation of nucleic acids from nasopharyngeal swab samples in\n30min, followed by CRISPR-based detection (403). While further validation is required to\nﬁ fully understand the bene ts of CRISPR-Cas technology, it has much potential for applica-\ntions for POC devices or high-throughput testing platforms (331, 395).\nSARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing.\nof SARS-CoV-2 obtained from clinical specimens can help identify the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic origins, delineate transmission events, unravel clues to pathogenesis, and moni-\n– tor viral evolution over time (404 408).

For SARS-CoV-2 genomes of\nquality sequences can readily be obtained with NGS directly from clinical specimens\nusing strategies like amplicon enrichment or bait capture techniques to favor the\nsequencing of the viral targets (413). NGS involves technologies such as sequencing by\nsynthesis, sequencing by ligation, and ion semiconductor sequencing (e.g., nanopore\nsequencing), each with its own advantages and limitations (404\nprinciple of each NGS technology has been reviewed elsewhere (404\nof them are illustrated in Fig. 9.\nTo date, a single commercial kit (Illumina Inc., USA) for NGS has been approved as a\nclinical diagnostic test under FDA EUA guidelines for COVID-19, which is based on\nsequencing by synthesis (414). However, no data are available to date to describe its\nperformance, advantages, or limitations compared to commonly used detection meth-\nods like real-time RT-PCR. Also, only a limited number of studies that have explored\nthe use of NGS for SARS-CoV-2 detection for the purpose of diagnostic testing are\n– available (413, 415 417). For example, using a laboratory-developed protocol for NGS,\nBhoyar et al. compared NGS and real-time RT-PCR on 752 clinical specimens processed\nﬂ in duplicate on a single ow cell (417). They demonstrated high concordance between\nthe methods and a diagnostic increase in the positivity of 5.7% with NGS (with the\ndetection of 6 cases that tested negative by PCR and 21 cases where PCR results were\ninconclusive). This study demonstrates the feasibility of processing 1,536 specimens in\na total of 17 h (11 h for sequencing and 6 h for analysis) (417). In another study, a low-\ncost NGS approach was shown to achieve high sensitivity for the detection of SARS-\nCoV-2 (84 genome units/ml), which is equal to or higher than those of some RT-PCR\nmethods; however, this study tested only 10 specimens (5 positive and 5 negative\nspecimens) (415).

These authors propose NGS\nas a tool for population-based surveillance rather than individualized testing for medi-\ncal decisions. While postulated to be able to achieve screening of thousands of sam-\nples on high-throughput NGS platforms, no data were provided to support the feasibil-\nity of this approach or the impact of such a high level of specimen pooling. Overall,\nsome data support the potential of NGS as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2, yet further\nﬁ analyses are required to understand its bene ts and limitations.\nDespite the potential for NGS as a diagnostic tool, the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 ge-\nnome sequencing using NGS technologies should also be recognized. For example,\nNGS technologies are challenged with specimens with low viral loads (413, 418), as\nﬁ insuf cient data or poor-quality results are obtained for subsequent analyses. Efforts to\nincrease sensitivity and quality are under way using target enrichment processes with\nNGS techniques such as multiplex PCR amplicon-based sequencing, hybrid capture-\nbased sequencing, and ultrahigh-throughput metatranscriptomic sequencing (413,\n419). Another limitation of NGS technologies is cost, which may be prohibitive for\nmany diagnostic laboratories. Furthermore, the complexity of the NGS work\nrequirement for sophisticated instrumentation and bioinformatics expertise may pose\nﬁ signi cant barriers to NGS access in many laboratories. If resources are limited, speci-\nmens could be prioritized and sent to referral laboratories to help inform public health\nresponses and global surveillance initiatives.\nWhile not routinely used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing in clinical laboratories,\ngenome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens with NGS technologies has\npaved the way for numerous applications, including investigations of disease pathoge-\nnesis, epidemiology, virus phylogenetics, SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and the impact of viral\nevolution on diagnostic testing or interventions like therapeutics and vaccines\n– (420 424).

Next, the\nﬁ available less than a month from the rst recognition of disease reported from Wuhan,\nHubei, China (10). With rapid access to SARS-CoV-2 genome data, molecular methods\nlike real-time RT-PCR were rapidly developed at the early stages of the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic and became the method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 detection worldwide. Through re-\nmarkable efforts from public health agencies and researchers, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequen-\nces have been made available in public data repositories such as the Global Initiative on\nﬂ Sharing All In uenza Data (GISAID) ( https://www.gisaid.org/\nBiotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\ndata help provide a snapshot of global diversity and data that could be used for epidemio-\nlogical investigations. In the initial stages of the pandemic, the high diversity of SARS-CoV-2\ngenomes was attributable to multiple independent importations of SARS-CoV-2 by travel\noverseas in countries of initial virus activity, and transmission routes could be investigated\n– (418, 430 434). Following global spread and closure of international borders, sequence di-\nversity was more limited, and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes was used in outbreak\ninvestigations and became particularly useful for cases in areas of unknown community\n– transmission (418, 430 434). However, with natural evolution in the human host, or selective\npressures from the recent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or exploratory therapeutics\n(i.e., antivirals or convalescent-phase sera), there are increasing chances for SARS-CoV-2 to\n– further diversify and acquire mutations (435 439).\nThe genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 stems from naturally occurring mutations in its\ngenome, which is common at higher frequencies in RNA viruses (440). Some mutations\nmight have no impact on SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (i.e., synonymous substitutions),\nbut these may affect the performance of diagnostic tests using NAATs if they occur in the\n– target region for the assays (40, 441 443). From the various genomes of SARS-CoV-2 that\nhave been sequenced since its discovery, the M, E, and RdRp genes were shown to be fairly\nconserved compared to the high divergence observed in some regions of the S genes (420,\n– 421, 439, 444 450). Mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 could also occur from point\nmutations, insertions, deletions, or recombination events that could affect protein sequence,\nstructure, and function (i.e., nonsynonymous substitutions). Both synonymous and nonsy-\nnonymous mutations can be useful for epidemiological investigations, but it should be\nﬁ noted that nonsynonymous mutations are of signi\nin terms of disease transmissibility and severity or could help the virus escape from thera-\npeutic (i.e., convalescent-phase sera or antivirals) or preventative (i.e., vaccines) interventions.\nMutations in S are of particular concern as S glycoprotein epitopes are major targets for cur-\nrent and exploratory vaccines (35, 451, 452). Multiple SARS-CoV-2 strain variants are circulat-\ning globally, but few are variants of concern (VOCs) (439). In the United Kingdom, a novel\nvariant of SARS-CoV-2 (0B/501Y.V1, VOC 202012/01, or B.1.1.7 lineage) emerged, with an\nunusually large number of mutations. This VOC has since been reported in several countries,\nincluding Canada and the United States. It contains a number of mutations in the S gene\n(e.g., N501Y, 69/70 deletion, and P681H), and while these mutations have yet to show any\nimpact on disease severity or vaccine effectiveness, some preliminary epidemiological data\nsuggest that this variant is associated with increased transmissibility (439). In Brazil, a SARS-\nCoV-2 variant from lineage B.1.1.248 was reported, with an E484K S gene mutation associ-\nated with reduced neutralization capability by convalescent-phase plasma (453\nmutations are concerning due to potential failures of therapeutic options or prevention\nstrategies like vaccines that target similar viral protein epitopes. Furthermore, a novel VOC\nﬁ from lineage B.1.1.248 called P1 was identi ed, with 12 mutations in the S gene, including\nboth E484K and N501Y, suggesting the potential for increased transmissibility and immune\nescape (438, 439). Ongoing surveillance should be encouraged to identify novel SARS-CoV-2\nvariants and characterize the potential impacts of VOCs.\nOverall, sequence-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is important to ensure that\ndiagnostic tests accurately identify the virus and that there are no changes with novel\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nrst SARS-CoV-2 genomes were made\n) and the National Center for\n).

Ag-RDTs (e.g., LFIAs) are often promoted as POC\ndevices for rapid testing and immediate management of patients in settings such as\n’ ﬁ physicians of ces or clinics; however, these tests are not always performed in these\nsettings. RDT is a more appropriate term if performed in a laboratory setting. At the\ntime of this review, few antigen-based detection assays have received EUA approval in\nthe United States and Canada, but many more applications have been submitted as\nlaboratory and/or POC tests (29, 30, 456, 457). Examples of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that\nhave received EUA for testing in laboratory or POC settings in the United States or\nCanada include technologies relying on a colorimetric LFIA with a visual readout,\nﬂ instrument-based antigen detection using a uorescence-based LFIA, a micro\nﬂ muno uorescence assay, and a chromatographic digital immunoassay (Table 2).\nWhile EUA was granted for some Ag-RDTs, at the time of this review, limited data\nhave been published on their clinical performance characteristics. The performance of\nantigen- and molecular-based POC tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 was the subject of a\nrecent Cochrane review (203), but limited data were available to be summarized (369,\n– ﬂ ﬁ 458 463). Brie y, the review summarized data from\nples. The average sensitivity of Ag-RDTs was found to be 56.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to\nﬁ 79.8%), and the average speci city was 99.5% (95% CI, 98.1% to 99.9%). In comparison,\nNAAT-based RDTs had an average sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI, 86.7% to 98.3%) and an\nﬁ ﬁ average speci city of 98.9% (95% CI, 97.3% to 99.5%). High speci\nboth molecular and antigen-based detection methods; however, low sensitivity was\nnoted for Ag-RDTs, but a high level of heterogeneity was noted between studies. This\nvariability could be explained by factors including the methods used for SARS-CoV-2\ndetection, the comparator methods during the evaluation, the patient populations\nassessed, SARS-CoV-2 prevalences, the timing of specimen collection, the specimen\ntypes used, and antigen stability during analyses.\nConsistent with the low clinical sensitivity of Ag-RDTs, the analytical sensitivity was\nﬁ de ned in some studies, which described LoDs of Ag-RDTs that were approximately\n1,000-fold lower than those of culture-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 and 10,000-fold\nlower than those of NAATs (463). Mertens et al. noted that when specimens with high\nﬁ viral loads were evaluated (de ned as specimens with real-time RT-PCR\n, 25), the sensitivity of Ag-RDTs increased to 74.8%, compared to an overall sensitivity\nof 57.6%, when all specimens were considered (459). Scohy et al. observed an overall\nsensitivity of Ag-RDTs of 30.2% (461). When specimens were further characterized by\nreal-time RT-PCR C values, the impact of the poor sensitivity of Ag-RDTs was clear.\nT\n5 , \u0001 With specimens with C values of 25 (1.8 10 copies/ml), C\nT T\n2 , \u0001 copies/ml), and C values of 35 (4.9 10\nT\nwere shown to be 100%, 70.6%, and 46.9%, respectively. Linares et al. showed that an\nAg-RDT achieved 86.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 75.0% to 97.0%) if symptomatic patients\nwith high or moderate viral loads were tested within 7 days of symptom onset (457).\nAs seen with all other SARS-CoV-2 tests, the timing of testing likely plays an important\nrole in assay performance. Recognizing the relatively poor sensitivity compared to\nNAATs but the potential role for Ag-RDTs, WHO interim guidance described situations\nwhere such tests could be considered (238). The WHO supports the use of Ag-RDTs for\nconditions such as (i) testing in areas where NAATs are not available (e.g., remote\nareas) or when the result turnaround times using NAATs are long; (ii) in outbreak inves-\ntigations, but the frequency of testing in these settings remains unclear; (iii) in areas\nwhere the prevalence is high; and (iv) for testing of asymptomatic contacts of positive\ncases.\nGiven the poor sensitivity of Ag-RDTs for detecting SARS-CoV-2, research is being\nperformed to improve sensitivity using novel sensor and biosensor technologies (464).\nSo far, a few studies have leveraged the power of electronic and electrochemical\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬂ uidic im-\nve studies, representing 943 sam-\ncity was observed for\nC values of\nT\n3 , \u0001 values of 30 (9.4 10\ncopies/ml), the sensitivities of Ag-RDTs\n31 cmr.asm.org",

        "text": "Methods for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)\nmethods to create fast and sensitive diagnostic devices for SARS-CoV-2 detection. For\nﬁ example, Seo et al. described a eld-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device\n2 \u0001 that detected SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 2.42 10\nmens, without sample pretreatment, in approximately 3 min (465). The FET sensor\nused SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to spike proteins, which were coupled\nto graphene sheets through a 1-pyrenebutyric acid N\n(PBASE) linker (Fig. 10B). With the high conductivity and other properties of graphene,\nreal-time dose-dependent detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen can be achieved down to\n1 fg/ml. While further optimization is needed to commercialize this technology, it has\nthe potential to help increase the sensitivity of antigen detection. In another study,\nMahari et al. developed an electrochemical device using a screen-printing technique.\nThey immobilized antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on screen-printed car-\nbon electrodes (SPCEs) to detect the virus and developed an integrated in-house-built\nportable device that could measure the changes in electrical conductivity upon the\nreaction between antigens and antibodies. The device was able to detect spiked SARS-\nCoV-2 antigens in saliva with an LoD of 90 fM within 10 to 30 s (466).\nWhile FETs and electrochemical sensors show promise to increase the sensitivity of\nantigen detection, the desire to achieve the highest sensitivity possible with RDTs has\nbeen the subject of recent debate (288, 299, 301, 467, 468). Some authors have pro-\nposed that with repeat testing, the chance of identifying SARS-CoV-2-infected individu-\n– als increases (288, 467 470). This may be true on a population level, where testing may\notherwise not have been performed (e.g., asymptomatic testing), and there would be\nfewer consequences if detection of the virus is missed. However, repeat testing and\nthe possibility of false-negative results in an acute-care setting pose many more chal-\nlenges, particularly when decisions have to be made at the time of or shortly after the\ntime of presentation. For existing or novel technologies, studies with more robust data\nﬁ are needed to better de ne the utility of Ag-RDTs in various settings. These should\ninclude prospective analyses that consider factors such as the timing of collection,\ntime of symptom onset, symptomatic and asymptomatic patient populations, disease\n’ prevalence, stability, and following the manufacturer\nand transport (i.e., direct testing of specimens and not using specimens in transport\nmedia).\nSerological Immunological Methods for SARS-CoV-2 Detection\nﬁ Serological assays detect antibodies speci\nﬁ rum, plasma, or whole blood (including ngerstick and heel pricks sometimes used in\nPOC testing), and the possibility of antibody detection in other body\n– liva is being explored (471 473). Given that the typical time required to detect immune\nresponses to SARS-CoV-2 is around 1 to 2 weeks, serological tests have limited utility\nfor SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in the acute stages of the illness but could have value once\n– immune responses have had time to occur (241, 474\ndetecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been developed and commercialized, and a list\nof authorized medical devices related to COVID-19 in the United States and Canada is\nregularly updated online (29, 30, 472, 479). Despite access to serological assays, the\ninterpretation of their results is further complicated in the postvaccine era for SARS-\nCoV-2, and the relevance of antibody detection must be considered in the context in\nwhich it is used and its limitations. Following a section describing serological methods,\na discussion on the relevance and possible applications is provided.\nSerological assays often use recombinant antigens to capture SARS-CoV-2-speci\nantibodies, with the N protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subu-\nnit of the S glycoprotein being the most commonly used antigens. Serological meth-\nods can target one or more immunoglobulin isotypes (i.e., IgA, IgM, or IgG) or total\nantibody, and theoretically, any of these isotypes could provide neutralizing activity\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 (480). IgM and IgG are commonly used immunoglobulins in sero-\nlogical assays for SARS-CoV-2, while IgA detection is less commonly used (479).

While more data are needed\nto fully understand the serological responses in different settings or patient popula-\ntions, it is clear that IgA, IgM, and IgG all have the potential to generate neutralizing\nresponses to SARS-CoV-2 (242, 481, 482).\nThe most common methods used are ELISAs in a 96-well plate format and CLIAs for\nautomated higher-throughput instruments (49, 479). LFIAs are also available to provide\nrapid results. It is unclear whether detectable antibodies in commercial serology meth-\nods are associated with immune protection, as large population-level studies and\nquantitative immunoglobulin analyses are required to assess if detection of SARS-CoV-\nﬁ 2-speci c immunoglobulins correlates with immune protection. However, studies are\nunder way to investigate the extent of neutralizing antibodies produced over time\n(242, 481, 482).\nThe performance of immunological assays remains unclear as there is a lack of a gold\nstandard for method comparison. Methods are often compared among themselves from a\nconsensus standard, but the true performance and relevance of antibody responses, and\nthe optimal testing algorithm, require further investigation (483). For now, the applications\nof serology include a role as an adjunct to molecular testing to support the identi\nof SARS-CoV-2 in a patient suspected of having COVID-19 (i.e., persistent or progressing\nsymptoms) but with the absence of testing or repeated negative (or indeterminate) results\nobtained by NAATs. It should be noted that some patients may be antibody negative at\nthe time of testing, but that does not preclude memory B cell activity or functional T cell\nresponses with subsequent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Some studies argue that immuno-\nlogical methods could also be used in seroprevalence studies to aid in ongoing outbreak\ninvestigations (to identify cases beyond the detectable window of NAATs), to determine\npast exposures of populations to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., health care workers or the general pop-\nﬁ ulation), or to assess attack rates in de ned populations or geographical areas. However,\ncorrelations to neutralizing antibody titers would be required to fully understand serologi-\ncal data, along with the impact of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other human coro-\nnaviruses as well as the impact of vaccines. High sensitivity and speci\nwith these many confounding factors, result interpretation is complicated (49, 484). The\nfollowing sections describe common methods used for SARS-CoV-2 serology, including\nELISAs, CLIAs, and LFIAs, along with a discussion of the potential value and limitations of\nimmunological methods.\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. While many permutations exist, enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) can be categorized into four main types: sand-\nwich, direct, indirect, and competitive (485). For the detection of SARS-CoV-2, indirect\n– ﬁ (210, 486 489), modi ed indirect (210), and double-antigen sandwich (206) ELISAs are\nthe most commonly used methods (Fig. 11A).\nIn the indirect ELISA method, a solid support, such as wells of a 96-well microplate,\n– is coated with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant antigens (210, 486\nﬁ plasma is added, and if present, SARS-CoV-2-speci\nbilized antigens. Following washing steps, a secondary antibody is then added that is\nﬁ speci c to the isotype targeted (i.e., anti-human IgM, anti-human IgG, or anti-human\nﬂ IgA). This secondary antibody (or conjugate) is linked to a\nﬂ ate uorescence or conjugated to an enzyme for colorimetric or chemiluminescent sig-\nnal generation following the addition of a substrate. Usually, colorimetric methods are\nused in which the optical density (OD) (i.e., absorbance) of the solution can be meas-\nured using a spectrophotometer and correlated with the concentration of the target\nantibodies. Other permutations of ELISAs are also possible, but while these techniques\nall share similarities in terms of their signal generation mechanisms, each can vary in\nperformance. Typically, the time to result for ELISAs is 1 to 5 h (41), and more recently,\nPOC applications of ELISAs for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been\nﬂ explored using micro uidics technology (490).

(B) Magnetic bead-based CLIA.\nChemiluminescence immunoassay. The chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) is an im-\nmunoassay that is commonly used in highly automated serological instruments and is\nknown for its high sensitivity compared to other serological assays (491). Similar to\nELISAs, variations of CLIAs have been applied for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibod-\nies, such as indirect (492, 493) and sandwich (239) methods.\nThe CLIA has two main differences from colorimetric ELISAs. First, the\nproduces light, which is detected by a luminometer in relative light units (RLU) rather\nthan the OD, which is an absolute value. To produce light, the conjugate uses an\nenzyme-substrate reaction such as the alkaline phosphatase (AP) and Lumigen APS-5\nsubstrates. Second, magnetic microspheres in a liquid-phase reaction rather than mul-\ntiwell plates are coated with the antigenic materials, which allows the easy separation\nof bound and unbound molecules by a magnet and faster reactions due to providing a\nlarge surface area and allowing the reactions to occur entirely in suspension (494\n(Fig. 11B). Some CLIAs have been commercialized and used on high-throughput auto-\nmatic analyzers. For example, the Liaison assay (DiaSorin, Italy) uses magnetic beads\ncoated with SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 antigens to detect IgG antibodies. This assay is ca-\npable of providing up to 170 results/h in a fully automated manner.\nFluorescent microparticle immunoassays. Recently, Norman et al. described a\nrescent nanoparticle immunoassay (FMI)-based single-molecule array assay that con-\nsisted of a mixture of four types of dye-encoded beads coupled to S, S1, S2, and N pro-\nteins and used for the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA\nantibodies (497). In this technique, an excess number of beads is utilized in comparison\nto the number of antibody molecules in the samples in a way that either zero or one\nantibody molecule binds to each bead. After the reactions occur between the coated\nbeads and the antibodies and other reagents, the beads are loaded into an array of\n216,000 femtoliter-sized wells for imaging, which allows the detection of antibodies\nwith single-molecule resolution. When tested on a set of 81 plasma samples, the tech-\nﬁ nique showed 86% sensitivity and 100% speci city for the samples during the\nﬁ week after symptom onset and 100% sensitivity and speci\nﬁ after the rst week after symptom onset (497).\nSimilarly, to facilitate the simultaneous detection of the IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes\nﬁ of SARS-CoV-2-speci c immunoglobulins, a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoas-\nsay based on Luminex technology was developed for detection on the Bioplex\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\nﬁ c antibodies.

In a meta-analysis and sys-\ntematic review (49), the pooled sensitivity (95% CI) for IgM detection was low in the\nﬁ rst week after symptom onset, at 25.3% (16.3% to 31.1%), for the LFIA but increased\nto 51.8% (30.3% to 69.6%) after 2 weeks and to 69.9% (58.4% to 79.9%) after 3 weeks.\nELISA detection of IgM showed similar values for weeks 1, 2, and 3 after symptom\nonset, at 26.7% (15.6% to 35.6%), 57.6% (15.9% to 88.2%), and 78.4% (54.1% to 91.9%),\nrespectively.

Next, the\npooled sensitivities for IgG at weeks 1, 2, and 3 after symptom onset were 13.4% (4.7\nto 29.6%), 50.1% (24.8% to 77.0%), and 79.7% (71.4% to 86.9%) for the LFIA; 23.7%\n(12.7% to 38.1%), 65.3% (46.3% to 79.4%), and 82.1% (76.4% to 89.0%) for the ELISA;\nand 53.2% (28.7% to 67.6%), 85.4% (48.1% to 98.1%), and 98.9% (86.9% to 100.0%) for\nthe CLIA, respectively (49).\nOverall, the performances of serology assays varied between methods and were de-\npendent on the timing of collection, and the applicability of these methods is limited\nto date. It is important to recognize that other factors such as antigens and the inher-\nent characteristics of a test or instrument used for antibody detection can also impact\nthe performance of immunological assays. Also, data summaries in recent meta-analy-\nses and systematic reviews so far have shown high levels of heterogeneity and a risk of\nbias and applicability between studies (472, 502, 503). Thus, careful attention should\nbe paid to the design of the studies, their limitations, and whether the conclusions\nﬁ derived from these evaluations are justi ed. It remains unclear whether antibodies will\nprovide durable protective responses against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections or\nwhat will be the impact of prior infection with seasonal human coronaviruses (474,\n475). It is possible that prior infection with other coronaviruses or other conditions (e.\ng., pregnancy or chronic illnesses) may cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 serology assays,\nﬁ and robust evaluation of methodologies should include speci\nrelated viruses and possible interfering substances (504, 505). The recent introduction\nof vaccine programs will further complicate the use of immunological methods as\ndiagnostic tests but may expand their use to determine whether individuals are\nimmune once exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection or following immuni-\nzation. This remains an active area of research that requires comparisons to neutraliz-\ning antibody titers and cell-mediated immunity.\nNeutralization assays and research areas of interest for serology.\nﬁ the scienti c community to help understand the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are\nfundamental in understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the interpretation of\n– SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics (506 509). There has been an extraordinary effort\nto rapidly develop serological methods in various formulations, and while some were\nlicensed under EUA in the United States and Canada, their use to make recommenda-\n’ tions on a patient s current or future susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains\nunclear (29, 30). Given the timing of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it\nis clear that serology would not be useful for diagnosis in acute phases of illness; anti-\nbodies would not be present in substantial quantities in this time frame to allow public\nhealth interventions (133).

To date, recommendations for the use of serology include clinical research (e.g.,\nseroprevalence studies) to help inform public health strategies or policies on a popula-\ntion level (102, 133, 241). For example, seroepidemiological studies can support\nongoing outbreak investigations or retrospectively assess infection rates in certain\npopulations (133, 511). On an individual level, serology may have considerations for\nﬂ individual patients with multisystem in ammatory syndrome or in situations where\nsuspect cases repeatedly test negative by NAATs, but symptoms persist (and the tim-\nﬁ ing ts into a period of at least 2 weeks after symptom onset) (102, 133, 241). Future\nresearch is required to further understand the full value of SARS-CoV-2 serology, espe-\ncially in the context of immunization with COVID-19 vaccines.\nKey areas of research interest should include the relevance and duration of anti-\nbody-based immune responses to better understand whether antibody responses in\ncommercial tests or LDTs correlate with protective immune responses against subse-\nquent SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the magnitude and duration of these responses.\nUnderstanding this correlation can be an important function to assess immunity on an\nindividual or population level or even to qualify blood donors desiring to become\ndonors of convalescent-phase plasma that could subsequently be used in clinical trials\n(512, 513). This would require a quantitative analysis of seroconversion (detection of\nmeasurable antibodies following infection), which would not be possible with qualita-\ntive assays such as LFIAs but may be possible using semiquantitative ELISAs (where\nantibody detection relies on a signal value that is normalized to a calibrator to estab-\nlish a signal-to-cutoff [S/CO] ratio) or, ideally, using quantitative ELISAs. Quantitative\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over time could be used to demonstrate serocon-\nversion, and quantitative ELISAs have become commercially available (e.g., the liquid-\nbased double-antigen sandwich ELISA from Roche [Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S]).\nQuantitative antibody analyses, paired with a fundamental understanding of how well\nserological methods correlate with neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), may help establish a\nthreshold where populations are protected from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection (known as a\ncorrelate of protection).\nﬁ The establishment of a correlate of protection\nof whether nAbs are produced, the extent to which they are produced, whether they pro-\nvide protection, and the duration of these responses and then analyzing these data in large\npopulation studies to correlate a level of nAbs that may confer protection against subse-\nﬁ quent infection (514). The quanti cation of nAbs in serum or plasma is performed using\nﬁ target- and immunoglobulin isotype-speci c neutralization assays 9like plaque reduction\nﬂ neutralization tests (PRNTs) (41, 241, 424, 515). Brie\neffectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cultured cells that would otherwise cause cy-\n– topathic effects (i.e., cell death/lysis) (41, 241, 511, 515 517).\nNonetheless, PRNTs are known to be time-consuming and laborious. To increase speci-\nmen throughput, microneutralization (MN) tests have been developed to detect nAbs to\nSARS-CoV-2 that rely on a principle similar to that of PRNTs but are performed in 96-well\nformats and without the need for semisolid overlays (511, 517).

In a limited data set from\nLong et al., it was noted that there was a decline in nAbs over time in both asymptom-\natic and symptomatic individuals (239). Similarly, Seow et al. performed a longitudinal\nstudy using sequential serum sampling and demonstrated that seroconversion was\nobserved in 95% of cases, with nAbs present 8 days after the onset of symptoms (531).\nThey also noticed that the magnitude of nAb responses depended on disease severity\nand waned over time, which was consistent with the results of others (206, 239,\n– 532 535). In some cases, nAbs persisted up to 60 days, while others approached the\nlimit of detection in this period (531). In a more recent study by Isho et al., the duration\nof antibody responses was evaluated in both serum and saliva (242). Antibodies to S\nprotein were detected in 90% of cases approximately 10 days after symptom onset,\nand longitudinal studies showed the persistence of nAbs up to 105 days. Similarly,\nﬁ nAbs (de ned using snELISAs) reached a maximum from days 30 to 45. Interestingly,\nthe sensitivities of anti-S or anti-RBD IgG in saliva were 89% and 85%, showing promise\nfor noninvasive methods for seroepidemiological studies and vaccine trials. The sensi-\ntivities of IgA, on the other hand, were 51% and 30%, and those for IgM were 57% and\n33%, respectively. It should be noted that the limited number of longitudinal studies\nﬁ seem to suggest that SARS-CoV-2-speci c antibodies decrease over a 2- or 3-month pe-\nriod; however, the longevity of humoral immunity is not yet fully understood for SARS-\nCoV-2. It is possible that memory T cells may still be able to mount effective responses\n– upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 (509, 536 538). Research into the role of cell-mediated\nimmune responses is needed to help unravel knowledge gaps for SARS-CoV-2 immune\nresponses (508, 509).\nOverall, whether derived from vaccines or natural infection, quantitative analyses of\nnAbs and establishing a correlate of protection would help inform public health and\nhealth care policies. Using neutralization assays with targets outside those used in vac-\nﬁ cines could still be of bene t to understand seroepidemiology to help better de\npopulations at risk, which would be important for vaccine trials or evaluations of novel\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2-speci c therapies like the use of hyper-IgG preparations or convalescent-\n– phase sera (520, 523, 539 541). Like any other method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, serol-\nogy research should consider antibody and cellular immune responses over time, have\na population- and individual-level testing perspective, as well as account for factors\nlike the presence or absence of symptoms, the timing from symptom onset (if present),\nthe severity of illness, host factors (e.g., age and medical comorbidities), and any collec-\ntion, transport, or processing steps that may affect the reliability of the analyte pro\nover time. Additional research is still needed to meet these goals.\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\nDespite the recent availability of vaccines, with the ongoing and rapid spread of\nSARS-CoV-2 worldwide, laboratory testing remains the cornerstone of public health\ncontainment and mitigation strategies.

Many technological advances have been made to detect\nSARS-CoV-2, which include NAATs to detect viral RNA and immunoassays to detect viral\nﬁ antigens or virus-speci c antibodies generated by the immune system in response to\nSARS-CoV-2. There is a growing list of commercially available methods for testing for\nSARS-CoV-2 (29, 30), and while many have been validated, the results of any test should\nbe interpreted with consideration of the context in which they are used and based on\nthe sum of all diagnostic evidence. When using any method to rule in or out SARS-CoV-2\ninfection, many factors should be considered, such as the timing and type of specimen\ncollection, the anatomical site of sampling, the method and its expected performance\ncharacteristics, host factors like compatible signs and symptoms (versus asymptomatic\ntesting), risk factors for serious outcomes, and disease prevalence in the population (82,\n– 542 544).\nNAATs like real-time RT-PCR quickly became the gold standard for diagnostic test-\ning. However, apart from those listed above, other considerations for NAATs are inher-\nent to the methodologies that are all based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. For\nexample, it is important to recognize that the performance of any molecular diagnostic\nﬂ method can be in uenced by sequence mismatches between the method\nand the different genome permutations of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and var-\niants. A possible strategy to reduce the chance of false-negative results that could\noccur by target mismatches is the simultaneous use of molecular methods targeting\nmore than one gene, as failure to detect a signal in one target gene may not preclude\ndetection in another (40, 164, 443). Alternative strategies could include the use of\ndegenerate primers and probes, a strategy used with other RNA viruses that are prone\nto mutation (443, 545, 546). Ongoing molecular surveillance using sequencing technol-\nogies should also be encouraged to monitor changes in SARS-CoV-2 genome sequen-\nces and COVID-19 epidemiology, particularly with an emphasis on variants linked to\nJuly 2021 Volume 34 Issue 3 e00228-20\n\nClinical Microbiology Reviews\ncation of COVID-19.

With human resource strains and supply chain\nshortages, providing NAATs during the pandemic was challenged by factors such as\nPPE, human resource strains for sample collection and testing, swabs, and test reagent\navailability for NAATs. From a clinical perspective, alternatives to NP swabs traditionally\nused for respiratory specimens were rapidly validated, as was the use of various trans-\nport media or swab-free options that are amenable to self-collection (e.g., saliva or sa-\nline gargles). The application of these specimens in the laboratory added complexity\nﬂ to the laboratory work ow and required rapid validations to ensure compatibility with\nnew or existing instrumentation.\nTo help meet capacity demands in the laboratory, laboratories were faced with the\nneed to rapidly procure large quantities of supplies, acquire instrumentation, train\nadditional personnel, and validate specimens, reagents, and equipment. Despite this,\nsupply chain challenges and rapid escalation of testing demands led to the need for\nresource-sparing strategies for NAATs, including specimen pooling and extraction-free\nNAAT protocols. Such strategies come at the cost of a relatively reduced sensitivity,\nwhich is associated with the potential risk of missing detection of SARS-CoV-2 in speci-\nmens with low viral loads. It could be argued that small reductions in sensitivity may\nhave little impact on the detection of most cases. Remnant SARS-CoV-2 at the outset\nof illness can persist for weeks and is unlikely to represent a period of communicability.\nOn the other hand, missing detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen with a low viral\nload at the early stages of illness may potentially lead to further virus spread. These\ntesting strategies should be carefully considered prior to implementation.\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2-speci c NAATs evolved over time to facilitate testing and streamline the lab-\nﬂ oratory work ow. For example, to further streamline testing for respiratory viruses, some\nmethods have now been multiplexed to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, in\nB viruses, and other respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In nonpandemic\nﬂ years, in uenza and other viral etiologies of respiratory tract infections represented a leading\ncause of death in North America, particularly among hospitalized patients with community-\n– acquired pneumonia (547 553). Interestingly, while cocirculation and coinfection with other\nrespiratory viruses were reported, there was little activity for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory\nviruses (554). It is unclear whether public health interventions (e.g., travel restrictions, social\ndistancing, handwashing, or PPE like masks) resulted in this decline or whether other factors\ninadvertently contributed to biases in data, such as fewer individuals seeking routine medi-\nﬂ cal attention or the lack of testing for in uenza and other respiratory viruses due to competi-\n– tion for resources used for SARS-CoV-2 testing (554\nusing multiplex technologies could provide an option for syndromic testing that would\nensure surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and other important respiratory viruses like in\nrus and appropriate interventions as needed (e.g., antivirals).\nThe public and political pressure for laboratory testing evolved with public health\nindications, and laboratory testing continues to guide public health policies as restric-\ntions ease or escalate throughout the ongoing pandemic (47, 484). One area of signi\ncant advancement in NAAT methodologies includes the use of automation to minimize\nhands-on processing time and increase specimen throughput. With the high demand\nfor laboratory testing, automation is an important consideration to avoid the possibility\nof staff repetitive-stress injuries. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scale\nand demand for laboratory testing have been unmatched by other pandemics.\nConcerns over SARS-CoV-2 prompted the testing of both symptomatic and asymptom-\natic individuals, in the context of public health case contact tracing and surveillance\npurposes. This includes testing for SARS-CoV-2 in both health care settings where\npatients are at increased risk (e.g., hospitals and long-term-care facilities) and situations\nwhere testing would not otherwise have been performed (i.e., professional sports\nteams, public events, prior to or after travel, and various workplaces).

Also, rapid validation of\nlaboratory tests and collection devices to meet regulatory requirements despite avail-\nability through EUA from regulatory bodies as well as the development of an informa-\ntion technology infrastructure to continuously improve the laboratory information\nﬂ management system (LIMS) in the laboratory testing work\nnear-real-time laboratory data to various stakeholders from local to national levels and\ndissemination to the public through various media formats are of great value. While\ndigitization was not an absolute requirement, the interconnectivity of data ensured\ntransparency and up-to-date information as decision support tools for recommenda-\n– tions, policies, and guidelines (53, 559 561). All of these have been identi\nWHO as key factors to control the COVID-19 pandemic (562).\nTo further enhance testing capacity and provide access for rapid SARS-CoV-2 test-\ning options, both antigen- and NAAT-based RDTs have been developed and are now\nreadily available (29, 30). These can support rapid laboratory and POC applications,\nscreening of large patient populations, or rapid deployment for assessments of target\nareas. NAAT-based RDTs rely on real-time RT-PCR or isothermal ampli\n(e.g., RT-RPA, RT-LAMP, and NEAR) and, like antigen-based RDTs, can provide rapid\nresults without complex instrumentation. The ease of use of these portable devices\nallows access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in settings that may have been prohibitive for\ntraditional laboratory NAATs. Throughout the literature, the main limitation noted for\nRDTs is their reduced sensitivity compared to traditional NAATs, but the evaluations of\nﬂ their performance do not always re ect conditions in which the RDT was licensed\nunder EUA, and the comparator method and distribution of expected specimen results\ncan have a large impact on assay performance (274, 290, 341, 342, 457). Even if these\nissues are not considered, and all SARS-CoV-2 detection results were considered of\nvalue, a possible strategy to mitigate the relatively reduced sensitivity of antigen- or\nNAAT-based RDTs is to increase the frequency of testing in the patient population over\ntime, to increase the chances of identifying individuals who fall in a period of high viral\nshedding (which would be less likely to be impacted by reduced sensitivity) (288, 299,\n301, 467, 468). On the other hand, the implementation of such strategies has chal-\nlenges of its own due to the limited scalability of RDTs, and the balance between sensi-\ntivity and testing frequency to achieve optimal SARS-CoV-2 detection in the target\nﬁ population would need to be de ned (288). Moreover, if, for example, EUA de\nuse of RDTs as within 7 days of symptom onset, this excluded their use for testing of\nasymptomatic individuals. While much development is ongoing to enhance existing\nRDT technologies or explore novel methodologies (53, 465, 466, 563\ncan effectively be used in practice is the subject of ongoing debate, and further\nresearch is needed to understand what setting they would best be of bene\nFor serology, currently available commercial assays are based on ELISAs, CLIAs, and\nLFIAs and are designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, the performance of\nserological assays varies across the different technologies, the timing from disease\nonset, and comparator methods. Clinical validation of serological methods is ongoing,\nbut recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews so far have shown high levels of het-\nerogeneity and a risk of bias and applicability (472, 502, 503). For example, with the\ntime required to mount anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during seroconversion (or possibly\nthe absence of seroconversion in mild disease), serology has limited value in identify-\ning SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of illness.

Detection of different antibody isotypes is possible with\ncommercial or laboratory-developed serological assays, and recent quantitative meth-\nods have now become commercially available; however, much is yet to be learned on\nhow these methods correlate with protective immune responses. Establishing corre-\nlates of protection will require longitudinal studies with parallel assessments of quanti-\ntative levels of nAbs and cell-mediated immune responses. Various neutralization\nassays have been established to assess and quantify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in\nserum or plasma (e.g., PRNTs, MN tests, or surrogate assays like PBNAs and snELISAs),\nbut data are scarce when it comes to longitudinal studies undertaken to fully under-\nstand the differences or similarities between commercial assays for the qualitative\ndetection of antibodies, quantitative antibody analyses over time, and relevance to the\nlevel and duration of protective nAb titers. While the longevity of humoral immunity is\nnot yet fully understood for SARS-CoV-2, some data suggest that antibody levels\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 wane over 3 months. Notwithstanding these observations, it is\npossible that memory T cells may still be able to mount effective responses upon reex-\nposure to SARS-CoV-2, and the role of cell-mediated immune responses may also pro-\nﬁ vide additional bene ts (508, 509). Further research is needed, as a greater understand-\ning of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental in making informed\nrecommendations for the use of immunological methods to assess current or future\nprotection against the virus, to determine meaningful endpoints in the development\nand evaluation of effective vaccines, or to assess effectiveness following immunization\nwith existing vaccines.\nOverall, methods based on RNA, antigen, or antibody detection as well as diagnos-\ntic imaging all have a place in our response to SARS-CoV-2, but ongoing research is\ncrucial to further optimize and apply all these testing modalities. The emergence of\nthe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a wave of innovative and creative thinking, and\nmore and more creative methods and platforms are being introduced with goals to\nincrease the armamentarium of diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection. An\nunderstanding of the advantages and limitations of each method used for SARS-CoV-2\ndetection as well as the development of novel methods will help us unravel the\nunknowns of disease pathogenesis, epidemiology, and transmissibility and help us de-\nvelop interventions to mitigate and contain its spread. There will always be a need for\nlaboratory testing and collaboration between clinical laboratories, public health, infec-\ntion prevention and control, and many others who contribute to the efforts to contain\nthe spread of COVID-19. On the other hand, it is also recognized that maintaining large\ninvestments in the rapid deployment of translational research and such a high degree\nof laboratory testing for COVID-19 will likely not be sustainable from an economic per-\nﬁ spective, and justi cations for such investments will be more dif\nﬁ signi cantly with vaccines.
