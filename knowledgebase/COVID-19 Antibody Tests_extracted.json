This review fo-\ncuses on the individual relevance of antibody tests: their accuracy in detecting\nprior infection, what past SARS-CoV-2 infection can currently infer about future\nimmunity or possible medical sequelae, and the potential future importance of\nantibody tests for vaccine selection and medical screening. Given uncertainty\nabout the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive predictive value) and\nwhat those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies and\nnecessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be\nused to inform individual decision making, and antibody testing should remain a\ntool of public health at this time.\nAdvent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Antibody Testing Market\nSerology testing (or equivalently, serological, or antibody testing) for coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) is useful to determine whether people were previously infected by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This capability contrasts with diagnostic\ntests, which are used to determine if someone is currently infected and presumably capable of\ninfecting others. Diagnostic tests either amplify viral genomic material or detect viral antigens\npresent in a patient sample. Although patients can simultaneously have a positive test result for\ndiagnostic and serologic tests, seropositivity is typically later in the course of disease. Serology\ntests also require a blood sample, as opposed to the upper respiratory specimens typically\nneeded for molecular diagnostics. Given rampant problems in diagnostic testing accessibility\nand the high incidence of asymptomatic infections, not everyone who is infected has the oppor-\ntunity to be tested before clearing the virus [ 1 , 2\n’ provide important information about a person s medical history.\nThe presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was originally hoped to be suf\nphysical distancing early in the pandemic, particularly in March 2020 [\nincluding the UK, Germany, and Italy, considered using antibody testing for\nﬁ or of cial documentation designating an individual immune to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and this\ncohort of already-recovered people was considered to be critical to opening the economy\n– [ 4 6 ]. Only a few months into the pandemic, it was too soon to determine if the presence of an-\ntibodies truly indicated protective immunity. Although serology tests have an international scope,\nthis discussion focuses primarily on the United States. On 31 March 2020, a bipartisan group of\n113 members of the US Congress urged the US Department of Health and Human Services to\nrapidly deploy antibody tests to help individuals determine if they had already had the disease\n‘ [ 7 ].

The ethical rami\nﬁ potential discriminatory practices based on serostatus, pro\n’ – and violations of workers rights [ 16 18\nit would create perverse incentives, driving people to try to become infected.\nInaccurate tests are still in use; yet, there have been no recalls. Though some major biotechnology\ncompanies have stopped selling tests following poor independent validation studies, the FDA\nissued guidance revoking Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for just two tests [\ntest manufacturers fraudulently claimed FDA approval for their tests [\ngroups have led the way in monitoring evaluations of antibody tests [\nmaintains a list of tests that have not received EUA and that should not be distributed, now\nincluding 155 serology tests, but this information is not prominently displayed [\nclear messaging on FDA EUA status has led to the use of potentially inaccurate tests [\nAntibody tests should not be used for individual decision making at this time. This paper de-\nscribes why this is the case: (i) antibody test results may be inaccurate without multiple sequential\ntesting due to low disease prevalence and statistical limitations; (ii) many tests on the market are\nnot of good quality, leading to inaccurate results; (iii) it is unknown whether past exposure to\nSARS-CoV-2 leads to durable immunity or if reinfection is possible; and (iv) it is unknown whether\ntransmission is possible even if reinfection does not lead to clinical symptoms. Antibody tests are\nvaluable at the population level to support serosurveillance studies, to determine the case fatality\nrate, to track increases or decreases in incidence and prevalence, and to grow the body of scien-\nﬁ ti c knowledge about medical sequelae following recovery [ 29\n– for Disease Control and Prevention\nthere was much higher COVID-19 prevalence than molecular tests showed [\nwish to be tested because a seropositive result may theoretically release them from the\nconstraints of physical distancing measures [ 31\nbeen very rare, it is possible, and the presence of antibodies cannot serve as proof of immunity\nto reinfection [ 32 ]. Consequently, individuals who have had past SARS-CoV-2 infection could po-\ntentially be reinfected and then contribute to viral transmission. Given current uncertainties about\nimmunity and SARS-CoV-2, individual use of antibody tests could lead to a false sense of\nsecurity.\nAccuracy of the Tests\nThere are several different tests to measure the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

No currently available test can tell an individual that they are immune to re-\ninfection by SARS-CoV-2, and no commercially available test can detect neutralizing antibodies.\nQuantitative tests, such as ELISAs and chemiluminescent immunoassays, provide richer data,\nsuch as levels of antibodies in a patient sample. Importantly, even quantitative tests such as\nELISAs often have stipulated within the EUA that the test is for qualitative use only in patients;\nﬁ quanti cation of antibody levels may be used for research only. Rapid diagnostic tests, typically\nﬂ lateral ow assays, are qualitative and provide a positive/negative readout of serostatus. The ac-\ncuracy and performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests vary; quantitative tests are generally\nmore accurate than qualitative tests, partially due to the detailed data generated [\ntest accuracy also increases with time since symptom onset, with greater than 14 days after\nsymptom onset being the optimal time for testing. Antibody levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nwane, especially after mild or asymptomatic infections, which may result in a negative test result\nif levels dip below the detection threshold [ 35\nessential in understanding the accuracy of a test. Such evaluations have revealed sensitivities as\nlow as 66%, whereas the FDA currently maintains a threshold of 90% sensitivity to even apply for\nan EUA [ 33 , 36 ].\nDue to statistical realities, test results are less accurate for an individual than for a population, if the\ntest is less than 100% accurate, and if the disease is of low prevalence. This has to do with the pre-\n‘ ’ dictive value, also referred to as the base rate fallacy,\nmance and the background population prevalence of disease. In other words, the more prevalent\na disease, the higher the predictive value for a positive test [ 37\nwith EUA are available [ 34 ]. For example, the Cellex test has 93.8% sensitivity and 95.8% speci\nso 6.2% of tests will yield false-negative results, and 4.2% of tests will yield false-positive results [\nIf disease prevalence is 5%, the positive predictive value is low: The probability that a positive test is\ntruly positive would only be 53%. The positive predictive value climbs with disease prevalence; for\n15% disease prevalence, the probability that a positive test result is accurate is 80%. There are online\ncalculators to determine these probabilities [ 26 , 39\nimportant even in low-prevalence settings, such as HIV/AIDS, the standard is to administer up to\nthree sequential tests [ 40 ].\nSerostatus and Immunity\nWhile knowledge of the presence (and levels) of antibodies is important in understanding past in-\nﬁ fections within a population, this section explores the signi\nunderstanding of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2.\nDurability of Immunity\nWhile the role of antibodies in protection against reinfection remains under investigation, the pres-\nence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 does indicate previous infection. The ability of the immune\nsystem to prevent reinfections differs with each pathogen; some pathogens elicit long-lasting,\nﬁ speci c immunity, whereas others do not. Immunity also differs among individuals, from the mag-\nﬁ nitude of the response to the speci city of the response [ 41 , 42\nchange rapidly over the course of infection and afterward [ 43 ].\nPast infection with SARS-CoV-2 is thought to lead to immunity from reinfection, but this remains\nan open research question. Studies in nonhuman primates show that recovered animals have de-\ntectable immune responses and are protected from advanced disease upon reinfection [\n216 Trends in Microbiology, March 2021, Vol. 29, No. 3\n\nTrends in Microbiology\nﬂ ‘ ’ ].

Most patients seroconvert, or be-\ncome antibody positive, after 2 weeks of infection [ 48\nﬁ – after symptom onset and increase steadily over the rst 3\n– Overall, antibodies appear to peak 14\n– 2 3 months [ 43 , 49 ].\nAntibody levels vary with isotype and disease severity; patients with severe disease have higher\nantibody levels that may persist longer. IgA and IgM levels decline after 60 days post\nﬁ onset, though IgG levels remain signi cant [ 42 , 50\nup to 90 days, even in mild cases [ 51 , 52\nlevels of antibodies than those with mild/asymptomatic cases, but the kinetics of antibody levels\nare similar across all cases [ 53 ]. In a study in Wuhan, China, researchers found that spike receptor\n– ﬁ binding domain (RBD) speci c IgG levels in asymptomatic patients were lower than in symptom-\natic patients, though prevalence was similar between the two groups (IgG prevalence of over\n– 80% of all cases 3 4 weeks after exposure) [ 35\nof the immune response. The cellular immune response, which involves T cells, cannot be\nmeasured through an antibody test.\nNeutralizing Antibodies\nMany studies analyzing antibody levels over time do not indicate if these antibodies are neutralizing\nand protect against infection in laboratory tests.

Researchers have also identi\nbodies can emerge as early as 9 days after symptom onset, appearing to peak at 31\n[ 58 , 59 ]. These levels also appear to correlate with the severity of disease [\nantibodies in patients with severe COVID-19 are up to seven times higher than in those\n– with mild disease [ 54 , 60 62 ].

While more accessible tests are being created to\nstudy neutralizing antibodies in lower biocontainment settings, T cell screening is more dif\nﬂ to scale up because most T cell assays rely on\nlaboratory.\nCurrent and Potential Uses for Antibody Tests for Individuals\nIdentifying and Managing Patient Care after Recovery from COVID-19\nCOVID-19 infection history could be important for future medical management. There is a grow-\ning body of evidence for medical sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in mild cases.\nSerology testing to identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection could be particularly helpful in pediatric\nﬂ patients with multisystem in ammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), as recommended by the\nInfectious Diseases Society of America [ 69\nhealthcare professionals to the possible link to SARS-CoV-2 infection; indeed, there is high\nseroprevalence in children presenting with MIS-C, accompanied by neutralizing antibodies to\n– the virus [ 70 72 ]. In adults, multiple sequelae have been associated with long-term health\n– impacts. Cardiovascular impacts, for instance, are seen in 20\ncardiovascular impacts such as myocarditis have been observed in young adults recovered\n– from COVID-19 [ 73 75 ].

This triage of individuals eligible for vaccination could be useful if vaccine doses are limited.\nHowever, antibody levels have been shown to wane over time. Therefore, an individual who was\nexposed several months before taking a serology test may have a negative test result.\nA Tool for Public Health, Not Individuals\nRecent public discussion has given many the false impression that a seropositive antibody test\n‘ ’ result indicates a return to normal and release from physical distancing public health measures\n[ 101 , 102 ]. However, given uncertainty about the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive\npredictive value) and what those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies\nand necessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be used to\navoid appropriate physical distancing or mask wearing.\nIndividual antibody test results should also be used with caution by employers or other institutions\nbecause they may be inaccurate or have performance discrepancies from those reported by the\nmanufacturer. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission clari\nemployers to require antibody testing as a prerequisite for their employees to return to work\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act [ 18\nsidering allowing only those with seropositive test results to participate in certain group activities,\nwhich creates perverse incentives [ 103\nto bar seropositive recruits, presumably because COVID-19 may lead to medical sequelae in the\nfuture; it will be important to monitor these efforts to protect individuals from ethical hazards and\nfrom discrimination [ 104 , 105 ].\nConcluding Remarks\nValidated and highly accurate antibody tests have an important role in the ongoing response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic at the population level. With the current limited understanding of\ncorrelates of immunity, prevalence of disease, and durability of immunity, antibody testing should\nremain a tool of public health until more is understood about long-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2\non the immune system. When more is understood about how antibodies re\nnity and how serostatus correlates with medical sequelae, the value of antibody testing at the\nindividual level can be re-evaluated (see Outstanding Questions ).\nReferences\n1.

This review fo-\ncuses on the individual relevance of antibody tests: their accuracy in detecting\nprior infection, what past SARS-CoV-2 infection can currently infer about future\nimmunity or possible medical sequelae, and the potential future importance of\nantibody tests for vaccine selection and medical screening. Given uncertainty\nabout the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive predictive value) and\nwhat those tests might indicate immunologically (durability of antibodies and\nnecessity for protection from reinfection), seropositive test results should not be\nused to inform individual decision making, and antibody testing should remain a\ntool of public health at this time.\nAdvent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Antibody Testing Market\nSerology testing (or equivalently, serological, or antibody testing) for coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) is useful to determine whether people were previously infected by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This capability contrasts with diagnostic\ntests, which are used to determine if someone is currently infected and presumably capable of\ninfecting others. Diagnostic tests either amplify viral genomic material or detect viral antigens\npresent in a patient sample. Although patients can simultaneously have a positive test result for\ndiagnostic and serologic tests, seropositivity is typically later in the course of disease. Serology\ntests also require a blood sample, as opposed to the upper respiratory specimens typically\nneeded for molecular diagnostics. Given rampant problems in diagnostic testing accessibility\nand the high incidence of asymptomatic infections, not everyone who is infected has the oppor-\ntunity to be tested before clearing the virus [ 1 , 2\n’ provide important information about a person s medical history.\nThe presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was originally hoped to be suf\nphysical distancing early in the pandemic, particularly in March 2020 [\nincluding the UK, Germany, and Italy, considered using antibody testing for\nﬁ or of cial documentation designating an individual immune to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and this\ncohort of already-recovered people was considered to be critical to opening the economy\n– [ 4 6 ]. Only a few months into the pandemic, it was too soon to determine if the presence of an-\ntibodies truly indicated protective immunity. Although serology tests have an international scope,\nthis discussion focuses primarily on the United States. On 31 March 2020, a bipartisan group of\n113 members of the US Congress urged the US Department of Health and Human Services to\nrapidly deploy antibody tests to help individuals determine if they had already had the disease\n‘ [ 7 ].
