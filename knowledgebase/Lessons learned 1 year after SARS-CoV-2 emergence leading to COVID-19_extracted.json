The initial cluster of cases\nwas related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market\nwhere wild game animals were also sold [ 1 ]. During\nsubsequent investigation, severe acute respiratory syn-\ndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was\ndetected in 33 out of 585 environmental samples\ntaken from the market [ 2 ]. However, 45% of the\ncases with onset before 1 January 2020 had no appar-\nent link to this market [ 3 ].

The COVID-19 pandemic was\nheralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs,\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The\nﬁ cant pandemic potential. The presence of a large\nreservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with\nthese areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical\nignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology,\nﬃ culties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact\nﬃ cacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of\nﬂ sequencing (NGS) on bronchoalveolar lavage uids\nof three Wuhan patients [ 6 ]. The complete genome\nsequences of SARS-CoV-2 clustered in a distinct\nclade from SARS-CoV within the genus Sarbecovirus .\nThe draft genome sequence was released on 10 Janu-\nary 2020, 10 days after the outbreak was announced.\nAs an escalating number of local cases was reported\nﬁ in Wuhan, a family cluster was identi ed in Shenzhen,\na city in southern China 550 miles from Wuhan,\nbetween 10 and 15 January 2020 [ 7 ]. Six members of\nthis family had returned from a trip to Wuhan\nbetween 29 December 2019 and 4 January 2020.\nTwo of them visited a local hospital where a paediatric\nrelative was hospitalized for pneumonia. Five of these\nsix family members were clinically and/or virologically\ndiagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) after returning to Shenzhen. In addition, a seventh\nfamily member, who did not go to Wuhan or visit wet\nkyyuen@hku.hk\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1898291\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ), which permits unrest-\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n508 K.

This familial cluster provided clear evidence of\nperson-to-person transmission and inter-city spread\nby air travel. Furthermore, the report of an imported\ncase in Thailand on 13 January 2020, and subsequently\nother countries suggested that global dissemination\nmight have occurred earlier by frequent air travel.\nBy the end of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was\nreported in 31 provinces in China, across East and\nSoutheast Asia, and to Europe and the United States.\nCommunity transmission was detected in other\nAsian countries, a large part of Europe, the Middle\n– East and the United States since February 2020 [ 8\n11 ]. Figure 1 gives a detailed account of the unfolding\nof the pandemic. By April 2020, the total number of\nCOVID-19 cases surpassed 1 million as more and\nmore countries entered partial or nation-wide lock\ndown. The death toll due to COVID-19 reached 1\nmillion on 25 September 2020. By 22 December 2020,\nwith the Chilean army reporting 36 cases at its research\nstation in Antarctica, COVID-19 cases have been\nﬀ reported to a ect all seven continents [ 12 ]. As of 4 Feb-\nruary 2021, there have been more than 103 million\nﬁ con rmed cases with over 2 million deaths [ 13 ].\nTaxonomy, genomic organization, and\nreplication cycle of SARS-CoV-2\nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of\nthe family Coronaviridae . This genus also includes the\nhuman respiratory pathogens SARS-CoV-1, Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV), human coronavirus (HCoV)-HKU1,\nand HCoV-OC43 [ 14 ]. Together with the closely\nrelated bat coronavirus RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-1,\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2 is classi ed as a member of the Sarbecov-\nirus subgenus of SARS-related coronaviruses [ 15 ].\nRapid characterization of SARS-CoV-2 by electron\nﬁ microscopy and NGS con rmed that it shared the\nstructural features and genomic organization of\nother betacoronaviruses [ 6 , 7 ]. It is a pleomorphic\n– enveloped virus (size range: 60 140 nm) studded\nwith distinctive surface spikes. The positive-sense\nsingle-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is\n– around 29 30 kB in size and is organized as methyl-\n’ capped-5 UTR-ORF1a/b-S-ORF3-E-M-ORF6-ORF7a\n’ /b-ORF8-N/ORF9b-ORF10-3 UTR-poly A tail [ 16 ]\n( Table 1 ). One of the earliest published genome,\nhCoV-19/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019 (GISAID acces-\nsion number (EPI_ISL_402119), has a genome size of\nﬁ 29,891 bp. A study using ribosome pro ling tech-\nniques showed the presence of additional upstream\nand internal open reading frames (ORFs) [ 17 ]. The\ngenome lacks the hemagglutinin esterase gene found\nin some other betacoronaviruses. ORF1ab, which\ncomprises two-thirds of the entire genome, encodes\n\na large polyprotein pp1ab, which is proteolytically\ncleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) critical\n′ for viral replication [ 16 ]. Towards the 3 end of the\ngenome, the S, E, M, and N genes encode key struc-\ntural proteins found in the mature virion [ 18 ]. The\nspike (S) glycoprotein forms trimers on the virion sur-\nface and binds to human angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry [ 19 ]. It con-\ntains two subunits S1 and S2 with a polybasic site\nﬀ PRRA at the junction, which enables e ective cleavage\nby furin and other proteases [ 5 ]. This multibasic clea-\nvage site appears to be an important virulence factor\nwhich may enhance virus replication and multiple tis-\nﬂ sue tropism as in the case of avian in uenza A(H5N1)\nvirus [ 20 , 21 ]. Mutations in this site can attenuate\npathogenicity in animal models and may be an attrac-\ntive option for designing live attenuated vaccines [ 21 ].\n’ Another cleavage site, called S2 , is located within the\nS2 region, and is cleaved by the transmembrane serine\nprotease 2 (TMPRSS2) [ 22 ]. S protein contains major\nimmunogenic epitopes, particularly concentrated in\nthe N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding\ndomain (RBD) of the S1 subunit, which are targets\nof neutralizing antibodies. The envelope (E) protein\nlikely forms a viroporin, which is important for virus\nassembly and release, and is also a putative virulence\ndeterminant [ 23 ]. The membrane (M) protein is an\nabundantly expressed structural protein within the\nlipid envelope that is also important for viral morpho-\ngenesis and interferon suppression [ 24 ]. Finally, the\nnucleocapsid protein (N) stabilizes the RNA genome\nin a helical complex [ 25 ] and serves as a key target\nof adaptive immunity. In addition, there are a number\nof accessory proteins, the function of some of which\nremains unknown. ORF3a may function as an inducer\nof apoptosis [ 26 ]. Both ORF6 and ORF8 are involved\nin interferon antagonism while ORF7a may be\n– involved in inhibiting cellular translation [ 27 29 ].\nORF8 can bind to IL-17 receptor A (IL17RA) which\nﬂ may modulate the in ammatory response, and higher\nblood levels of soluble IL17A has been associated with\nmilder disease [ 30 ]. Interestingly, circulating variants\nwith loss-of-function deletions in SARS-CoV-2\nORF3b, ORF7a/7b, and ORF8 have been found, indi-\ncating that these are not absolutely essential for viral\ninfection and may be remnants required for infection\nﬁ – of an unidenti ed intermediate host [ 31 34 ]. ORF9b,\nan accessory protein translated from an alternative\nopen reading frame within the N gene, interacts with\nthe host mitochondrial import receptor protein\nTOM70 and suppresses type I interferon response\n[ 30 , 35 ]. As for ORF10, it appears dispensable for cel-\nlular infection [ 36 , 37 ].\nStages of the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 have\nbeen rapidly inferred from empirical data and extant\nﬁ knowledge of other betacoronaviruses. The rst step\nin cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2 is the binding\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nFigure 1. Chronology of events leading to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nof S protein to the host cell surface entry factors such\nas the membrane associated and soluble ACE2 recep-\ntor [ 38 ] which may be preceded by weaker binding of\nthe S protein to attachment factors such as heparan\nsulphate [ 39 ]. Other entry factors that facilitate attach-\nment or entry include neuropilin-1 [ 40 , 41 ], the tyro-\nsine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) [ 42 ], CD147\n[ 43 ], high-density lipoprotein (HDL) scavenger recep-\ntor B type 1 (SR-B1) [ 44 ], integrins [ 45 , 46 ], angioten-\nsion II receptor 1 (AT1) and vasopressin receptor 2,\nbut their role in natural infection is currently unclear.\nProteases such as surface TMPRSS2 and endosomal\ncathespsin L [ 46 ] cleave the S protein to activate\nSARS-CoV-2 entry by endocytosis and membrane\nfusion [ 22 ]. Within the cell, the virus uncoats to\nrelease its genomic RNA into the cytoplasm for trans-\nlation [ 47 ]. The translated pp1a and pp1ab polypro-\nteins are proteolytically cleaved to individual Nsps,\nmany of which form the replicase-transcriptase com-\nplex [ 48 , 49 ]. These complexes are localized within\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 509\nspecialized double membrane vesicles (DMV). Within\nthe DMV system, the complex operates to replicate\ngenomic RNA and transcribe subgenomic RNAs,\nwhich are subsequently translated into structural pro-\nteins [ 50 ]. Viral assembly occurs within the endoplas-\nmic reticulum, Golgi, and intermediate complex\n(ERGIC) where membranes studded with viral struc-\ntural proteins interact with N-encapsidated viral geno-\nmic RNA [ 51 ]. Pre-activation of S protein by host\nfurin protease may occur before mature viruses are\nreleased from the cell by exocytosis of secretory ves-\nicles. As in other coronaviruses, subgenomic RNAs\nare produced, and most subgenomic RNA consists\n’ of a leader sequence in the 5 untranslated region of\nthe genome and connected to the S gene or other\n’ genes in the 3 end [ 50 ]. Hence, translated viral pro-\n’ teins are more abundant towards the 3 end of the gen-\nﬀ ome, which may a ect the sensitivity of diagnostic\n– assays using them as targets for RT PCR or antigen\ndetection. One exception is the nsp1, which has been\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n510 K. K-W. To et al.\nTable 1.

Direct RNA sequen-\ncing also reveals the presence of non-canonical subge-\n’ nomic RNAs in which the 5 breakpoint is located\nwithin the ORF1a gene [ 50 ]. As for the putative struc-\n′ tural RNA found in SARS-CoV-2, the 5 UTR has sev-\n– eral stem-loops (SL1 5) which may be involved in\nmediating viral replication as in other betacorona-\nviruses. The ORF1a-ORF1b junction has a pseudo-\nknotted structure pivotal for programmed ribosomal\nframeshifting and translation of the ORF1ab polypro-\n′ tein. The 3 UTR has the s2 m motif, conserved octa-\nnucleotide and many unexpected folds [ 53 ].\nVirus evolution\nThe origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. Recombi-\nnation is a frequent event for the viral subgenus Sarbe-\ncovirus , which contains SARS-CoV, bat SARS related\nCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [ 54 ]. Some studies suggested\nthat the bat SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses are\nrecombinants of lineages related to SARS-CoV and\nSARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 may result from\nrecombinations between these bat SARS related\n\nRole in pathogenesis\nSuppression of interferon response\nInhibit interferon signalling\nInterferon antagonist\n′\nκ Interacts with NF- B-repressing factor to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8)\ninduction, which potentially increase IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of\nﬂ neutrophils and overexuberant host in ammation [ 49 ]\nPotent interferon antagonist\nPotent interferon antagonist\nPotent interferon antagonist\nInduce apoptosis [ 26 ]\nInterferon antagonist [ 33 ]\nMay conduct Ca2+ out of the ERGIC lumen to activate the host\nﬂ in ammasome [ 23 ]\nInhibit type 1 and III interferon production by direct interaction with\nRIG-I/MDA-5 and impeding downstream signalling [ 24 ]\nPotent interferon antagonist (block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear\ntranslocation) [ 29 ]\nInhibit interferon pathway\nInhibit type I interferon [ 35 ]\n]\ncoronavirus and the pangolin SARS related corona-\nvirus [ 55 , 56 ]. However, another study suggested\nthat recombination may not be involved in the gener-\nation of SARS-CoV-2, but the RBD of SARS-CoV-2\nshares the same ancestral trait as bat viruses [ 57 ].\nThe divergence date between SARS-CoV-2 and bat\nsarbecovirus has been estimated to be 1948 [ 57 ].\nﬁ Since its rst detection in humans in December\n2019, many mutations have been found throughout\nthe SARS-CoV-2 genome [ 58 ]. The mutation rate\n− 3 has been estimated to be 1.1 × 10 nucleotide substi-\ntutions per site per year [ 59 ]. The time of origin of\nSARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be late November\n2019 [ 59 ]. The mutation rate is fastest at the S, N,\nORF1ab, ORF3a, and ORF8 genes [ 60 , 61 ].\nIn addition to inter-host genetic diversity, mixed\nviral populations can be present within an individual\npatient. A variant initially present at low frequency\nin an individual can become the predominant viral\npopulation during the course of illness. In our pre-\nvious study, we demonstrated the emergence of the S\nprotein W152L mutation in a patient with severe dis-\nease [ 62 ]. In a study analysing the viral genomes from\npatients in Austria, an intra-host minor variant was\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nfound to be transmitted to others, and become the pre-\ndominant viral variant in another patient [ 61 ].\nVirus mutations and variants\nﬀ SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into di erent clades and\nlineages ( Figure 2 ). Currently, there are three major\nﬀ nomenclature systems for the di erent clades or\nlineages. The GISAID and Nextstrain systems were\nused since the beginning of the pandemic, and the\nﬁ clades or lineages are de ned by signature mutations.\nThe GISAID clade is currently divided into S, L, and\nﬀ V, and di erent clades carrying the D614G mutation\n(G, GH, GR, GV), and O. The Nextstrain is divided\ninto 19 (A, B) and 20 (A-J) according to the year\nand order when the clade emerged. Although GISAID\nand Nextstrain nomenclatures are useful in under-\nstanding the virus evolution in a macroscopic scale,\nthese systems are not able to delineate more detailed\noutbreak cluster information. The Pango lineage,\nﬁ rst proposed in July 2020, is a dynamic system,\nwhich takes into account whether the lineage is\nactively spreading or not [ 63 , 64 ]. The Pango lineage\nﬁ system has a much ner resolution than GISAID or\nNextstrain, and is particularly useful to capture the\nemergence of novel variants.\nAs the virus evolves, many novel variants have been\nfound. The analysis of viral variants helps epidemiolo-\ngical investigations. For example, whole viral genome\nanalysis during the 2020 summer outbreak in Hong\nKong showed that the outbreak was most likely linked\nto viral variants imported by travellers [ 65 ]. Further-\nmore, variant analysis can be used to identify factors\nﬀ that a ect transmissibility or virulence of the virus.\nIn vitro screening using serial passage or site-directed\nﬁ mutagenesis identi ed mutations in the S protein that\nallow the virus to escape neutralization by convales-\nﬃ cent plasma or infect cells more e ciently [ 66 , 67 ].\nLong-term SARS-CoV-2 shedding in immunocom-\npromised individuals with acquired hypogammaglo-\nbulinemia can lead to a long duration of virus\nshedding and a larger genetic diversity with continu-\nous turnover of dominant viral species throughout\nthe course of infection. Deletion H69 and V70 in the\nS protein NTD was reported in a B-cell depleted\npatient which may be related to selection by convales-\ncent plasma therapy [ 68 ]. Furthermore, remdesivir\nfailure with D484Y mutation at RNA dependent\nRNA-polymerase was also reported in a B-cell immu-\nﬁ node cient patient with protracted SARS-CoV-2\nshedding [ 69 ].\nViral variants can also emerge during circulation in\nanimals. Since SARS-CoV-2 can infect many animals\nnaturally or experimentally [ 70 ], there is always a\ndanger of human-to-animal SARS-CoV-2 trans-\nmission, followed by the genesis of mutants in animals\nwhich then jump back into human. Mink-to-human\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 511\ntransmission has been documented in Europe [ 71 ].\nFurthermore, the S N501Y variant can be selected in\nvirus adaptation experiments using Balb/c mice [ 72 ].\nSeveral notable variants have emerged since the\nbeginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nB.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and P.1\nﬁ (VOC202101/02) which were rst reported from the\nUnited Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively\n[ 73 ]. These variants usually increase transmissibility\nand, thereby, rapidly replace existing lineages. Some\nof these variants share certain critical mutations in\nthe S protein RBD. For example, N501Y is present\nin the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, while E484 K is present\nin the B.1.351 and P.1 in addition to N501Y and\nD614G ( Table 2 ).\nﬁ ﬁ One of the rst major variants identi ed for SARS-\nCoV-2 were deletions at the S protein S1/S2 junction.\nThese were readily seen during passage in Vero E6\ncells [ 21 ]. S1/S2 junction deletion variants have been\nfound to be less virulent in a hamster model [ 21 ]. S1/\nS2 junction deleted variants also naturally exist in\n’ patients samples before any passage in cell cultures[ 74 ].\nORF8 is a unique protein in SARS-CoV-2 [ 16 ] and\nis found to be immunogenic [ 75 ]. However, ORF8-\nﬁ deleted or truncated mutants have been identi ed fre-\nquently. In a Singapore study, patients infected with\nORF8-deleted mutants have milder disease than\nthose infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 [ 31 ].\nORF3b deleted mutants have also emerged with the\nD614G mutation. Truncation of ORF3b confers the\nloss of its function of interferon antagonism [ 32 ].\nD614G mutation was not reported in the initial out-\nbreak in China, but is now found in almost all strains\nglobally. Several studies have evaluated the impact of\nD614G on the SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, they show\nthat D614G variant replicates to a higher titre in vitro\nﬃ and in vivo , and transmits more e ciently, but does\nﬀ ﬁ not a ect disease severity or confer a signi cant change\n– in neutralizing activity of convalescent sera [ 66 , 76 78 ].\nﬀ Mechanistically, D614 mutation a ects the confor-\nﬃ mation of the S protein, which allows more e cient\nbinding to the human ACE2 receptor [ 79 ].\nThere have been multiple outbreaks of SARS-CoV-\n2 infection among mink farms in Europe [ 80 ]. Mink-\nﬁ associated human infections have been identi ed [ 71 ].\nA unique lineage has been found in these mink-associ-\nated human cases from Denmark, including 4\nΔ mutations in the S protein ( 69-70, Y453F, I692 V,\nM1229I). Y453 has been shown to be involved in\nreceptor binding [ 66 ]. Preliminary investigation with\n9 COVID-19 convalescent serum specimens showed\nﬁ a statistically signi cant reduction in neutralizing anti-\nbody titre [ 73 ].\nﬁ The B.1.1.7 variant was rst detected in September\n2020, spread rapidly in south-eastern England by\nDecember, and has become the predominant variant\nin the UK. This variant has increased transmissibility\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n512 K. K-W. To et al.\nFigure 2.\nﬁ with the best-\nﬀ ing di erent clades of SARS-CoV-2.

Clade information as inferred by Nextstrain or Pango\nminant lineage that is found in almost all local cases in Hong Kong since November 2020. The reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1\n(GenBank accession number MN908947.3) is used as the root of the tree.\nand is now found worldwide [ 81 ]. This variant is\nﬁ de ned by 17 mutations, including a non-synon-\nymous S N501Y at RBD, and the P681H mutation\nwhich is located in the furin cleavage site. However,\nno change in neutralizing activity by sera of vaccine\nrecipients of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was\nfound against pseudoviruses bearing the Wuhan refer-\nence strain and the B.1.1.7 variant [ 82 ].\nThe B.1.351 variant has rapidly increased in South\nAfrica in late 2020. This variant possesses several\nmutations in S protein NTD (L18F, D80A, D215G,\nΔ 242-244, R246I) and RBD (K417N, E484 K, and\n\n(A) Whole genome phylogenetic tree of betacoronaviruses.

Further-\nmore, neutralizing antibody against the B.1.351 var-\niant could not be detected in 48% of convalescent\nsera of COVID-19 patients [ 83 ].\nThe P.1 variant has 17 unique mutations including\nRBD E484 K and N501Y mutations has emerged [ 84 ].\nThis is a descendent of the lineage B.1.1.28.1, and now\nknown as the P.1 lineage which is mainly limited to\nBrazil, but has also been reported in Japan, Korea,\nand Faroe Islands [ 85 ].\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nTable 2.

In\nﬁ the rst case of reinfection reported in August 2020,\nthe second episode was caused by a D614G variant\n[ 86 ]. In a reinfection case reported from Brazil, the\nsecond episode was caused by the E484 K variant\n[ 87 ]. Virus carrying the E484 K was shown to be less\nsusceptible to neutralization by sera from mRNA vac-\ncine recipients [ 88 ].\nTransmission routes\nSARS-CoV-2 is believed to spread predominantly via\nshort-range airborne aerosol, respiratory droplets,\nand direct or indirect contact with infectious respirat-\nory droplets. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2\nhas been elegantly demonstrated in the hamster\nmodel [ 89 , 90 ]. Low level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (con-\n3 3 centrations in air up to 3.4 × 10 RNA copies per m\nair sampled) could be detected in the air samples\nobtained from the environment housing COVID-19\npatients even in the absence of aerosol-generating pro-\n– cedures [ 91 94 ]. Viable SARS-CoV-2 virus could be\nisolated from air samples collected as far as 4.8 m\naway from COVID-19 patients with estimated viral\n– concentrations of 6 74 TCID units/L of air [ 95 ],\n50\nsubstantiating the hypothesis that aerosol dissemina-\ntion of SARS-CoV-2 may serve as a source of\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 513\ninfection. Large quantities of particles, with the\nmajority of less than 5 microns, can be emitted during\nnormal speech, and the amount is positively correlated\nwith the loudness of vocalization [ 96 ]. Aerobiological\nstudy showed that particles produced in the human\nrespiratory tract represent a continuum of sizes\ninstead of a sharp distinction into respiratory droplet\n≥ ( 5 microns) or airborne aerosol (<5 microns). The\nconcentration of respiratory droplets and airborne\naerosol carrying SARS-CoV-2 should be inversely pro-\nportional to distance from the source patient. Short-\nrange airborne spread should be the predominant\nroute of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nIn addition, contact with frequently touched sur-\nfaces, shared items, and food that are contaminated\nby infectious respiratory droplets likely represent\nanother route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [ 97 ].\nOne study found that 5% of the near-patient environ-\nmental samples contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a\n2 median viral load of 9.2 × 10 copies/mL [ 98 ], with\n’ the highest contamination rates on patients mobile\nﬂ – phones, oors, bed rails and air exhaust vents [ 91\n93 , 98 ]. Though still considered controversial as a por-\ntal of transmission, several outbreaks have been linked\nto contaminated frozen food, their packaging\nmaterials and storage environments [ 99 ]. The half-\n– life of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was 1.7 2.7 days at\n20°C, which is reduced to a few hours at 40°C [ 100 ].\nAt the highest viral load excreted by infectious\npatients, viral particles remained viable for up to 28\ndays at 20°C on common surfaces such as glass, stain-\nless steel, and polymer banknotes [ 100 ]. The relative\nﬀ humidity also a ects the rate of viral decay, which\nwas most rapid at 65% relative humidity and slower\neither at lower (40%) or higher (75%) humidity [ 101 ].\n– Other routes of transmission, including faecal oral,\nﬂ and contact with various body uids including urine,\n– tears, and breast milk, have been postulated [ 102\n106 ]. Indeed, oral SARS-CoV-2 inoculation can estab-\nlish subclinical respiratory infection with virus shed-\nding in the hamster model [ 107 ]. Human vertical or\nperinatal transmission from mother to babies is rare\nbut possible [ 108 ].\nVertical transmissions in high rise buildings by fae-\nﬀ ﬀ cal aerosols through chimney e ect, wake e ect and\nminor leaks in sewage, vent pipes, or light wells were\nﬁ reported [ 109 ]. However, the signi cance of these\nalternative routes of transmission in driving the com-\nmunity epidemic is still unclear.\nEpidemiological characteristics\nThe mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection\n– was 4.0 5.2 days, and incubation period of longer than\n14 days has been reported [ 3 , 110 ]. During the early\nstage of the pandemic, the mean serial interval was\n– 4.0 7.5 days [ 3 , 110 , 111 ], the epidemic doubling\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n514 K. K-W. To et al.\nTable 3.

But estimating R with precision is\n0\nﬃ di cult due to the substantial proportion of unde-\ntected cases and varying testing policies. Literature\non transmission heterogeneity is scarce. Heterogeneity\nin infectious disease dynamics, where most individuals\ninfect only a few others while a small subset of the\npopulation is responsible for the majority of new\ncases, is commonplace. Retrospective history from\n135 cases between 21 January and 26 February 2020\nﬁ in Tianjin, China, showed signi cant transmission\nﬃ heterogeneity with a coe cient of dispersion of 0.25\n[ 115 ]. The estimated overall infection fatality ratio\n(IFR) in China was 0.66% which increased with age\n[ 116 ]. This is similar to the IFR estimate of 0.6%\ninferred using the corrected IFR on the Diamond\nPrincess cruise ship [ 117 ].\nAn important reason for the rapid spread of\nCOVID-19 is the presence of asymptomatic and pre-\nsymptomatic transmission. Asymptomatic or mildly\n– symptomatic cases constitute 30 60% of all patients\n\nFeatures of vascular involvement References\nﬃ ﬁ [ 143 , 151 , Perivascular cu ng by lymphocytes with brin/ hyaline\n153 ] thrombi seen within pulmonary vessels and capillaries\nCongested vessels\nEpicardial capillaries with prominent lymphomonocytic [ 144 , 151 ]\nendotheliitis\nMacrovascular or microvascular thrombi\nIntraluminal megakaryocytes\nIntravascular thrombi with perivascular microhaemorrhages [ 174-179 ]\nﬂ ﬁ and intramural in ammatory in ltrates\nMultiple microscopic ischaemic infarct with or without\nantigen expression at endothelium\nHemosiderin granules and pigmented casts, together with [ 143 , 145 ,\nabundant erythrocyte with obstruction of peritubular 167 ]\ncapillary lumen with activation of endothelium\nﬁ Platelet brin thrombi in sinusoid, central vein or portal vein [ 143 , 145 ,\nMegakaryocytes in sinusoid 167 ]\nSinusoidal congestion\nIschaemic necrosis\nSplenic infarction [ 143 ]\nﬁ Dermal in ltrate with perivascular and intramural [ 145 , 162 ]\nlymphocyte in muscular wall of small vessels\nﬁ Occasional intravascular hyaline/ brin thrombi\nVascular deposition of C4d by immunohistochemical\nstaining\nﬁ Villous infarction, atherosis and brinoid necrosis of maternal [ 146 ]\nvessels\n[ 147 ]\ninfected with SARS-CoV-2 [ 118 , 119 ]. In ex vivo\nhuman lung tissues, SARS-CoV-2 generated 3.2-fold\nmore infectious virus particles than did SARS-CoV-\nﬁ ﬂ 1, but did not signi cantly induce host pro-in amma-\ntory response [ 120 ], which explains the high pro-\nportion of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic\ncases in the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in con-\ntrast to SARS-CoV-1 patients whose viral load in\nnasopharyngeal aspirates peaked at around day 10 of\nsymptoms [ 121 ], the viral load in the respiratory\nsamples of COVID-19 patients was highest during\nﬁ the rst few days of symptom onset [ 90 ]. It was esti-\nmated that presymptomatic transmission accounted\n– – for 4.2 44.4% of secondary COVID-19 cases [ 122\n125 ]. The secondary attack rate within Wuhan house-\nholds was 15.6%, with the presympomatic cases being\nthe most infectious [ 126 ]. In addition, the lack of herd\nimmunity at the early stage of the pandemic adds to\nthe susceptibility of the general population. The esti-\n− mated seroprevalence rate in Wuhan was 3.2% 3.9%\n– ﬁ in March 2020 [ 127 129 ], and similar gure of 4.1%\nwas recorded in California in April 2020 [ 130 ].\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nﬀ Mask-o activities such as dining, singing, swim-\nming, and other physical activities are especially\ndangerous in overcrowded indoor venues with subop-\ntimal ventilation or contaminated frequently-touched\nsurfaces that are poorly sanitized [ 131 ]. Thus out-\nbreaks have been reported as clusters in family\nhomes, restaurants, bars, markets, religious premises,\ncruises, carriers, construction sites, dancing studio,\nschools, nursing homes, and healthcare facilities\n[ 132 ]. Several superspreading events have been high-\nlighted. A British individual who attended a confer-\nence in Singapore in January 2020 has spread the\nvirus across the UK, France, and Japan through the\nexposure at a ski resort, where 13 of the 21 exposed\npeople eventually tested positive [ 133 ]. From late Feb-\nruary to early March 2020, an outbreak associated with\nthe Sunday worshipping event in a church caused\nﬁ 61.3% of the 8162 con rmed COVID-19 in the Repub-\nlic of Korea [ 134 , 135 ]. The outbreak related to an\nindex patient on the Diamond Princess cruise ship\nhas led to the quarantine of the passengers and cruise\nmembers at the Port of Yokohama in Japan, on which\n696 of the 3711 passengers (18.8%) tested positive for\n– SARS-CoV-2 [ 118 ]. In fact, using a susceptible\n– – exposed infectious removed (SEIR) model that inte-\ngrates dynamic mobility networks based on mobile\n“ ” phone data, a small minority of superspreader at\npoints of interest, most notably full-service restau-\nrants, was found to account for a large majority of\nCOVID-19 cases [ 136 ]. Selective implementation of\nﬁ speci c restrictive measures at these critical control\nﬀ points of interest may be most e ective. Hospital out-\nbreaks at wards, dialysis centres, and outpatient clinics\n[ 137 , 138 ] fuel the community outbreaks and vice\nversa which adds to the burden of infection control.\nThe long environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2,\nhigh proportion of asymptomatic or mildly sympto-\nmatic patients, peaking of viral load before or at pres-\nentation and therefore its high transmissibility\nwarrants universal masking, diligent hand hygiene,\nand stringent social distancing measures for the suc-\ncessful control before the herd immunity is built up\nby vaccination.\nHistopathology and pathogenesis of\nCOVID-19\nSARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in multiple organs as\n– shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies [ 139 150 ].\nwith common histopathological features summarized\nin Table 3 . Autopsy showed that pulmonary involve-\nﬀ ment with di use alveolar damage together with\nhyaline membrane formation and pulmonary micro-\nemboli are the most prominent acute histopathologi-\nﬁ cal ndings [ 151 ] ( Figure 3 ). These features were\nﬂ often associated with high in ammatory cytokines\nand increased angiogenesis in fatal cases [ 152 , 153 ].\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 515\nThe hyaline membrane was attributed to an increase\n“ in vascular permeability (termed as bradykinin\n” storm ) and accumulation of hyaluronic acid in the\nalveolar space, leading to trapping of high volume of\nwater [ 154 ]. Moreover, serum autoantibodies directed\nagainst many immunomodulatory proteins including\ncytokines, chemokines, complement activation com-\nponents, and cell surface proteins were found in a\nﬁ high throughput extracellular antigen pro ling study\nwhich may add to the tissue damage by immune com-\nplex deposition and complement [ 155 ]. These auto-\nantibodies may also impair immune function and\nvirological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor sig-\nnalling. The presence of these autoantibodies includ-\ning those against interferons is strongly associated\nwith disease severity [ 156 ].\nAlthough SARS-CoV-1 is more virulent based on in\nvitro studies in terms of replication and cell damage\n[ 142 , 148 ], SARS-CoV-2 appears unique in causing\nendotheliitis [ 152 , 157 ], as evident by viral particles\nin vascular endothelium using electron microscopy\n[ 157 ]. Soluble endothelial markers such as angiopoie-\ntin-2 level are positively correlated with severity of\nCOVID-19 [ 158 ]. Furthermore, endotheliitis increases\npropensity of thromboembolism and multisystem\ninvolvement in COVID-19 patients [ 152 , 157 , 159 ,\n160 ]. Widespread thrombosis could be related to the\nﬂ hyperin ammatory and hypercoagulopathy states,\n“ ” termed as immune-thrombosis [ 160 , 161 ]. Direct\nendothelial injury triggers innate immune response,\nincluding activation of monocytes and complement\npathways, leading to deposition of terminal comp-\nlement components C5b-9 (membrane attack com-\nplex), C4d [ 162 ], and mannose binding lectin\n(MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP) in the\nmicrovasculature [ 163 ]. Complement and endo-\nthelium activation induce the production of von Will-\nebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII), while\nreducing antithrombin and ADAMTS13 activity\n[ 164 ]. Activated neutrophils release neutrophil extra-\n– cellular traps to stabilize microthrombi [ 165 167 ].\nMacro- and micro-vascular thrombosis and intralum-\ninal megakaryocyte are more common features than\nﬁ lymphocytic in ltration of myocardium in patients\nwith cardiac involvement [ 168 ]. In terms of lymphoid\norgan involvement, T-cell depletion occurred in the\nspleen [ 169 ]. Necrosis or atrophy in the lymphoid tis-\nsue of lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen are\ncommonly observed extrapulmonary pathologies\n[ 170 ].\nﬀ COVID-19 may a ect the central nervous system\nﬀ due to indirect e ects of cytokine storm or suspected\ndirect virus invasion. The S1 protein can cross the\nblood brain barrier in a mouse model. Furthermore,\nintranasally administered S1 also entered the brain\nﬁ with signi cant uptake at olfactory bulb and hippo-\ncampus, although at levels around 10 times lower\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n516 K.

The\nﬂ endotheliitis and systemic in ammatory response syn-\ndrome with neuronal activation are also postulated to\nexplain the neurological manifestations [ 172 , 173 ].\nAutopsy studies of the brain showed that ischaemic\ninfarct with perivascular microhaemorrhage together\nwith neutrophilic plugs or intravascular microthrombi\n– were common features [ 174 179 ]. Similarly, radio-\nﬂ logical features of vascular in ammation were\nobserved in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of\nﬁ the brain [ 180 ]. T-cell lymphocytic in ltrates were\ncommonly seen at perivascular, parenchymal as well\nas leptomeningeal areas with microglial and astrocyte\nactivation [ 167 , 169 , 175 , 178 , 179 ]. Clinical improve-\nment of encephalopathic symptoms with steroid tends\nﬂ to suggest a dominant role of in ammatory response\n[ 181 ]. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain\nﬂ and cerebrospinal uid by immunohistochemical\n– staining and RT PCR yield inconsistent results\n[ 167 ], as viral RNA detected from brain biopsy may\ncome from vascular endothelium instead of neurons.\nThe localization of S antigen and visualization of\nvirus-like particles at the endothelium were observed\nin some patients with endotheliitis while only few\ncould demonstrate S protein expression in cortical\nﬁ astrocytes [ 174 , 182 ]. The more consistent nding is\nthe expression of virus nucleocapsid antigen in olfac-\ntory sustentacular and horizontal basal cells in some\npatients and also in the olfactory neurons in infected\n\nﬀ use alveolar\nltration; a medium size blood vessel containing thrombus which almost blocks the entire lumen\ned H&E image shows severe hyaline membrane formation in the alveolar space\nﬁ ed H&E image shows severe mononuclear immune cell in ltration in the alveolar\nuorescence stained SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen in alveoli (white\nhamsters, suggesting that direct neuronal invasion by\nvirus is possible [ 183 ].\nﬁ Immunological pro le of patients with\nCOVID-19\nﬁ Innate immunity is the rst line of defence against\ninfection. Yet SARS-CoV-2 may evade innate immu-\nnity by antagonizing host interferon response. Viral\nproteins that have been shown to antagonize inter-\nferon response include Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp12, Nsp13,\n– Nsp14, Nsp15, ORF3, and ORF6 [ 27 , 142 , 184 186 ].\nFurthermore, the frequency of dendritic cells, T cells,\nﬁ NK cells, and monocytes was signi cantly reduced in\nthe peripheral blood of acute patients when compared\nwith healthy donors [ 187 ]. In particular, decrease in\nlevels of CCR2 expression in dendritic cells may lead\nto poor maturation on stimulation [ 188 ], further redu-\ncing levels of interferons, and hence poor stimulation\nof CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes during acute phase\nﬁ of infection [ 187 ]. Furthermore, in ltration of mono-\nﬂ cytes/macrophages in lungs can increase pro-in am-\nmatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 and\nIP-10, which fuels the cytokine storm [ 189 ]. Th2 cyto-\nkines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, are elevated in patients\nwith severe COVID-19 [ 190 ].\nFor humoral adaptive immune response, most\nﬁ recovered patients develop SARS-CoV-2-speci c\nIgA, IgG, and IgM response not only against S\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n(including RBD) and N but also other non-structural\n– proteins [ 191 193 ]. The peak antibody response\nappears at around 1 month [ 194 ] and is higher\namong patients with more severe disease [ 195 ]. Most\nstudies showed a static or slow decline in neutralizing\nantibody and IgG response after few months [ 196 ,\n197 ], while IgA and IgM declines more rapidly\n[ 194 ]. One study estimated the half-life of S protein\nIgG to be 140 days [ 198 ]. Notably, some patients\nwho recovered rapidly showed increasing titres over\ntime [ 196 ]. The IgG and IgM levels in saliva correlate\nﬀ with those of serum [ 194 ]. There is also a di erence in\nantibody response between adults and children. While\nadults develop antibody against both N and S proteins\nequally well, children have a stronger anti-S antibody\nﬁ response than anti-N antibody [ 199 ]. S-speci c mem-\nory B lymphocytes showed increase in abundance over\ntime, suggesting that patients can develop rapid anti-\nbody response during reinfection, as was seen in our\npreviously reported reinfection case [ 198 , 200 , 201 ].\nThe exact duration of detectable serum neutralizing\nantibody titre after natural infection or vaccination\nstill awaits long-term follow-up study.\nCases of reinfection have been reported [ 86 ], and\nneutralizing antibody could not be detected at pres-\nentation of the second episode of infection 5 months\nﬁ after the rst episode [ 201 ]. Magnitude and duration\nof persistence of IgG or neutralizing antibody\ncorrelate with severity of COVID-19 in some studies\n[ 193 , 195 ].\nFor cell-mediated adaptive immunity, SARS-CoV-2\nleads to T-cell lymphopenia and functional impair-\nment of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during the\nacute stage [ 187 , 202 ]. Total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells\nare reduced in both mild and severe diseases, but par-\nticularly lower among severe cases [ 203 ]. SARS-CoV-2\nﬁ speci c CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can be detected in\nabout 50% of patients during the acute period and\n>80% of patients in the convalescent stage [ 204 ,\nﬁ 205 ]. The development of SARS-CoV-2 speci c T-\ncell response is impaired among patients with severe\nCOVID-19 [ 204 ]. There is a higher frequency of mem-\nory CD4 than CD8 T-cell responses against N and\nﬁ RBD [ 204 ]. SARS-CoV-2-speci c CD8+ memory T-\ncell responses are directed primarily to the S and M\nproteins especially among those who recovered from\nsevere COVID-19. The levels of T 17 cells were elev-\nH\nated among severe cases [ 206 ]. The frequency of T fol-\nlicular helper cells during the convalescent phase is\nhigher among patients with severe disease than those\nwith milder disease, which correlated with the neutra-\nﬁ lizing antibody titre [ 207 ]. SARS-CoV-2 speci c T-cell\nimmunity can also be found in up to 83% of non-\nCOVID-19 individuals which may suggest some\ncross reactive T-cell immunity that may or may not\n– be protective [ 208 210 ]. Pre-existing memory CD4+\nT cells are cross reactive for SARS-CoV-2 and other\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 517\nﬁ seasonal coronaviruses [ 210 ]. SARS-CoV-2-speci c T\nlymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+) decreased with half-\n– lives of 3 5 months [ 198 ].\nThe overall clinical phenotype of COVID-19 is\ndetermined by the degree of early control of viral\nload by innate and adaptive immune responses, the\nﬂ in ammatory and apoptotic damage of cells triggered\nby the burden of virus, the functional reserve of the\nﬀ a ected organs and the compensatory regenerative\nor reparative power of the host tissues.\nClinical manifestations\nCOVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease which\ncan manifest as acute upper or/and lower respiratory\ntract syndrome of varying severity. The symptom\nonset of COVID-19 is more likely to be gradual\nﬂ than the abrupt onset in in uenza. The patient can\nmanifest with asymptomatic virus shedding, or a\nself-limited syndrome of fever, fatigue, myalgia,\narthralgia, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, and/or conjunc-\ntivitis at one end of the spectrum. But it can also\nprogress to persistent fever, cough, hemoptysis, silent\nhypoxia, chest discomfort or pain, respiratory failure,\nor even multiorgan failure [ 211 , 212 ]. Impairment of\nsmell (hyposmia, anosmia, and parosmia) or taste\n(dysgeusia) has been recognized as important che-\nmosensory disturbances in COVID-19 [ 213 ]. Non-\nconductive olfactory dysfunction (OD) may be the\nsole manifestation [ 214 ]. Other extrapulmonary\nmanifestations include diarrhoea, lymphopenia,\nthrombocytopenia, deranged liver and renal func-\ntion, rhabdomyolysis, meningoencephalitis, stroke,\n– seizure, Guillain Barré syndrome, cardiac arrhyth-\nmia or heart block, pancreatitis, Kawasaki disease\nlike multisystem vasculitis, skin rash or chilblain-\nlike lesions, thromboembolism, and acute thyroiditis\n– [ 215 217 ]. In an analysis of 72314 COVID-19 in\nChina up to 11 February 2020, 81% of the laboratory\nﬁ con rmed patients had mild to moderate illness, 14%\nhad severe disease, and 5% were critically ill requir-\ning intensive care [ 218 ].\nClinical improvement of mild and moderate cases\ngenerally occurs around 10 days after symptom\nonset which coincides with at least 1 log reduction\nof respiratory viral load [ 219 ] and the rise of serum\nantibodies against N or S protein [ 220 ]. However,\nclinical deterioration of moderate disease to respirat-\nory failure may also occur at this time with persistent\nsalivary viral load and increasing lymphopenia in\nthese worsening patients [ 221 , 222 ]. Chest radiograph\nor lung CT scan typically showed bilateral multifocal\nand peripheral ground glass opacities ( Figure 4 )\nwhich may deteriorate to dense consolidation in pro-\ngressive disease [ 223 ]. The radiological abnormalities\nusually peak by 2 weeks after symptom onset and\nﬁ are replaced by brosis with recovery [ 224 ]. The\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n518 K. K-W. To et al.\nprognosis of COVID-19 is worse in elderly obese\nmales or those with comorbidities such as hyperten-\nsion, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerotic vascular dis-\nﬁ eases, vitamin D de ciency, and other chronic\nmedical illness [ 225 ]. Patients with X-linked putative\nTLR7 loss of function variant, autoantibody against\ntype 1 interferons, defective mutations of IFNAR2 or\nother interferon signalling genes, antiviral restriction\nenzyme activators (OAS), blood group A and the\nassociated SNPs found by GWAS are associated with\n– ﬀ severe disease [ 226 230 ]. Acute kidney injury a ected\n>20% of hospitalized patients and >50% of those\nrequiring ICU admission, but the rate varies widely\nbetween studies [ 231 ]. The overall crude fatality rate\nﬁ for laboratory con rmed cases is about 2% [ 232 ],\nbut can be as high as 21.9% in patients over 80 years\nof age [ 233 ]. Early bacterial and fungal superinfections\nare uncommon but late superinfections, including\ninvasive pulmonary aspergillosis, were reported in\nthose with prolonged ICU stays and treatment by\nimmunomodulatory agents [ 234 ].\nFollow-up study at 6 months after COVID-19\nsymptom onset showed that over 60% of these patients\nhad persistent symptom of fatigue or muscle weakness\nﬃ [ 235 ]. Sleep di culties (26%), anxiety or depression\n(23%) were not uncommon [ 235 ]. Other symptoms\ninclude smell or taste disorder, palpitations, joint\npain, dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and chest pain\nwhich constitute a constellation of symptoms termed\n“ ” post-acute COVID-19 syndrome . This group of\n“ ” patients are also called COVID long haulers [ 236 ].\nThose with severe disease requiring respiratory sup-\nﬀ port had lung di usion impairment [ 235 ]. However,\nlittle objective evidence of post-acute COVID-19 syn-\ndrome can be found on investigations which bear\nsome similarity to chronic fatigue syndrome or myal-\ngic encephalomyelitis. The cause was speculated to a\ndysregulated immune system which was activated to\nﬁ ght SARS-CoV-2 but failed to dampen down after-\nﬀ wards [ 237 ]. The other di erential diagnoses are either\nan autoimmune process triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or\na persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection which cannot be\neasily detected by conventional testing [ 238 ]. The\nrelationship between the presence of serum autoanti-\nbodies and the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome\nrequires further investigations.\nIn general, children have a shorter and milder\ndisease than adults [ 239 , 240 ]. However, a rare but\nlife-threatening Kawasaki-like disease, known as\nﬂ multisystem in ammatory syndrome in children\nﬂ (MIS-C) or paediatric in ammatory syndrome tem-\nporally associated with SARS-CoV-2, are seen\nduring the convalescent phase of the illness [ 97 ,\n241 ]. Children with MIS-C are usually older, has a\nlower lymphocyte and platelet count, and a higher\nlevel of CRP and ferritin than those with Kawasaki\ndisease [ 242 ].\n\nLaboratory diagnosis\nOne of the most important aspects in curbing the\nspread of the virus and improving the prognosis is\nrapid yet accurate diagnosis of infection followed by\ntimely isolation, contact tracing and treatment. Mol-\necular testing is now the mainstay of diagnosis, sup-\nplemented by point-of- care antigen testing (POCT)\n[ 243 ]. Antibody detection aids in assessment of immu-\nnity, contact tracing, and disease prevalence in the\npopulation. A multitude of diagnostic platforms,\nboth in-house and on commercial platforms, are\ndeveloped to meet these demands [ 244 ].\nSpecimen collection\nViral load in the respiratory tract is highest at or soon\nafter symptom onset [ 222 ], and it decreases at a rate of\n1 log per week [ 90 ]. Testing nasopharyngeal aspirate,\n10\nnasopharyngeal swab, or throat swab is adequate for\nearly-stage infection, especially asymptomatic or\nmild upper respiratory tract infections. Patients with\nlower respiratory tract symptoms should send sputum\nto enhance sensitivity [ 245 ]. Though broncho-alveolar\nlavage (BAL) showed the highest positive rate among\nﬀ di erent respiratory specimens, it is only indicated\nin those with severe lower respiratory tract involve-\nment when the nasopharyngeal and throat specimens\nare tested negative [ 246 ]. Posterior oropharyngeal\nsecretion (POS) or deep throat saliva is increasingly\nstudied as it represents a pooling of posterior naso-\npharyngeal, oropharyngeal and lower respiratory\nsecretions during the supine position during sleep,\nwhen taken in the early morning before breakfast\nand mouth rinsing [ 90 , 247 ]. It can be self-collected\nby patients with instructions, reducing patient dis-\ncomfort, circumventing swab shortage, and minimiz-\ning aerosol exposure for health care professionals.\nThe cost of collecting POS could be 2.59-fold lower\nthan nasopharyngeal specimen [ 248 ]. The sensitivity\nis comparable with nasopharyngeal swab in properly\n– collected specimens by cooperative patients [ 249\n252 ] . The sensitivity does not vary much between\nearly morning and at least 2 h after meal [ 253 ].\n– For non-airway specimens, viral shedding by RT\nPCR was found in faecal material in 40.5% of patients\nﬁ after the rst week of symptom onset and could per-\nsist for 3 weeks or more [ 254 ]. Presence of viral RNA\nﬀ in the sewage system may provide a cost-e ective and\nnon-invasive way of monitoring the disease spread\nwithin the community and may serve as an early\nwarning system for population that lacks access to\nﬃ healthcare [ 255 ]. Enveloped virus has a nity to bio-\nsolids which may allow testing of sludge at sewage\ntreatment plants with better sensitivity than testing\nﬂ in uent [ 256 ]. Composite sampling is used in most\nstudies [ 257 ]. Sewage sample should be concentrated\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nFigure 4.\nglass opacities: (A) transverse view; (B) coronal view.\nﬃ followed by e cient RNA extraction to prevent inhi-\nbition of molecular assays [ 256 ]. Viral RNA can also\nbe detected in the blood in about 30% of severe\npatients, but the detection rate is much lower in\nmilder cases [ 90 , 246 ]. Even without ocular symp-\ntoms, the conjunctival secretion may contain a\nsmall amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in around 8%\nof patients [ 258 ]. Viral RNA is rarely found in the\nurine [ 246 ].\nTo accommodate the large amount of specimen for\nscreening asymptomatic population, pooling of clini-\n– cal specimens, up to 5 30 samples per pool [ 259 ,\n260 ], is an additional strategy to cope with reagent\nshortages, at the expense of possibly longer processing\ntime and reduced diagnostic sensitivity of the weakly\nﬃ positive sample [ 261 ]. It is e cient only when the\nexpected positive sample number is low as positive\npool requires individual retesting [ 262 ]. Strategic\nﬁ retesting of a de ned group [ 263 ] and the use of math-\nematical models to stratify pool size by age groups\nbased on their respective disease prevalence may\nﬃ improve e ciency [ 264 ].\nMolecular testing\nReverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\n– (RT PCR) is the most widely used technique. Poten-\ntial molecular targets for SARS-CoV-2 include struc-\ntural proteins (e.g. S, E, helicase (hel), N, M and\nnon-structural regions such as the RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase region (Rdrp), and other ORF1ab\ntargets [ 52 , 265 , 266 ]. There is currently no consen-\nsus on which gene confers the best diagnostic per-\nformance. Presently, one bat SARS related CoV\nﬁ conserved and one SARS-CoV-2 speci c target\nﬀ regions are recommended to mitigate e ect of ran-\ndom mutation or genetic drift while maintaining\nﬁ ﬀ speci city [ 265 ]. However, mutations can a ect the\n– sensitivity of detection by RT PCR. For example,\nmutations in the S gene of the UK variant B.1.1.7\n– has led to the failure of some RT PCR primers tar-\ngeting the S gene [ 267 ].\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 519\nTypical changes of COVID-19 pneumonia on lung computed tomography showing bilateral multifocal patchy ground\nHigh throughput and automated commercial plat-\nforms have been developed for molecular SARS-\nCoV-2 diagnosis. Molecular POCT enables rapid test-\ning near the site of collection in areas with little labora-\ntory support [ 249 ]. To improve diagnostic sensitivities\nof molecular assays, clustered regularly interspaced\nshort palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based technology\nhas been employed by coupling with Cas enzyme\n[ 268 ]. Target enrichment sequencing by NGS with\nnanopore or Illumina technology can unravel the\nentire genome within a few days. Sharing of genetic\ndata facilitates tracking of disease spread, understand-\ning of disease transmission route, monitoring of viral\ngenome evolution and detecting novel variants.\nAntigen detection\nN is abundantly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 and is thus\nwidely used as the target for COVID-19 antigen test\n[ 269 ]. Detection is achieved by capturing viral antigen\nﬁ in clinical specimens by monoclonal antibodies xed\non a membrane in colorimetric lateral immunoassays.\nThough this assay can be delivered as POCT in an out-\npatient or even non-healthcare setting, it has low sen-\n– sitivity when compared with RT PCR assays\nespecially for samples with low viral load. In general,\nantigen test is negative when their Ct values on quan-\n– titative RT PCR are more than 25, although the Ct\nﬀ values vary with di erent assays and conditions [ 270 ].\nAntibody detection\nWhile antibody testing is generally not useful for acute\nmanagement, it can be used for retrospective diagnosis\nand seroprevalence study to understand herd immunity\nﬂ [ 271 ]. Commonly employed techniques are lateral ow,\nﬂ chemiluminescent, immuno uorescent, and enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assays [ 272 , 273 ]. Median sero-\nconversion times following symptom onset are 11 days\nfor total antibodies, 12 and 14 days for IgM and IgG\n– respectively [ 220 ]. After 14 days, 56 97% of patients\n– develop IgM and 91 100% of patients develop IgG\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n520 K. K-W. To et al.\nﬁ ﬀ [ 274 ], with no signi cant time di erence between IgM\nand IgG response [ 275 ]. IgM peaks at around 3 weeks\nafter symptom onset and falls to baseline level after\nday 36 [ 276 ]. The duration of IgG or neutralizing anti-\nbody positivity remains controversial. Some study\nshowed decrease in neutralizing antibody titre within\n3 months after symptom onset, while others showed\nno such decrease [ 200 ]. Antibody development against\nS and N protein is comparable by 1 month after infec-\ntion [ 277 ]. Titre of anti-S or anti-S RBD antibody may\nﬂ better re ect protection against reinfection [ 277 ].\nTraditional neutralization assay requires manipu-\nlation of live virus and necessitate biosafety level 3 lab-\noratories. Pseudovirus neutralization assay using\nvesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing S protein\nof SARS-CoV-2 containing the RBD, can be used in\nbiosafety level 2 facilities [ 278 ]. Neutralizing antibodies\nare directed towards the RBD and NTD. Both sites are\nsituated at the tip of the S protein. Surrogate virus neu-\ntralization assay based on antibody-mediated blockage\nof RBD-ACE2 interaction has been developed [ 279 ].\nStudies have shown serological cross-reactivity\nbetween SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with decreas-\ning frequency of cross-reaction from N protein, S\nprotein to RBD domain by enzyme immunoassay\nﬁ [ 52 , 280 ], with no signi cant cross neutralization\n[ 281 ]. Cross-reactivity against other seasonal human\ncoronaviruses in SARS-CoV-2 infection has been\nshown as well, though intensity is not as great as\nthat with SARS-CoV [ 52 , 281 , 282 ].\nAntibody test has also been used to assess whether\nSARS-CoV-2 has circulated in the population before\nthe isolation of the virus. A study from Italy reported\nthat anti-RBDantibody could be found in bloodsamples\ncollected as early as September 2019 [ 283 ]. In the United\nStates, 106 of 7389 of residual specimens from blood\ndonors collected between 13 December 2019and 17Jan-\nuary 2020, tested positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2,\nand neutralizing antibody was detected in 84 of 90 of\nthese samples [ 284 ]. Though these studies suggest that\nCOVID-19 may have emerged much earlier than the\nﬁ – ﬁ rst RT PCR con rmed case, the possibility of EIA\ncross-reactivity with other coronaviruses cannot be\nexcluded.\nViral culture\nInfectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens\ncan only be demonstrated by cell culture assays in bio-\nsafety level 3 facilities. Furthermore, cell culture is\nessential for the evaluation of potential antiviral com-\npounds and vaccines [ 285 ]. Viral culture turned nega-\ntive in 97% of patients by 10 days after symptom onset,\ncoinciding with the time of seroconversion [ 286 ]. Dur-\nation of live virus shedding is believed to be even\nshorter in faecal specimen [ 287 ]. Shedding is prolonged\nin severe and immunocompromised cases [ 288 ].\n\nVero E6 cells which have abundant ACE2\nexpression are commonly used for virus isolation\n[ 142 ]. Vero E6 cell line that expresses TMRPSS2 can\nresult in better culture yield and reduce the likelihood\nof in vitro selection of S1/S2 junction site deletion\nmutant [ 289 , 290 ]. SARS-CoV-2 also grows in\nhuman continuous cell lines such as Calu3 (lung can-\ncer), Huh7 (liver cancer) and Caco2 (colonic cancer)\n[ 142 ]. It grows modestly on U251 (glioblastoma)\nwhich is not seen with SARS-CoV-1 [ 142 ]. Organoid\nsystems such as bat and human intestinal organoids\nare susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and are developed to\nbetter study tissue tropism, the dynamics of infection\nand testing of therapeutic targets. SARS-CoV-2 is suc-\ncessfully cultured in human intestinal organoids from\na stool specimen with high C value of 33.6, demonstrat-\nt\ning possible enteric infection by oro-faecal route [ 141 ].\nTreatment\nExcept in places where all infected cases are legally\nrequired for mandatory hospital isolation, most patients\nwith mild symptoms require only home isolation, moni-\ntoring, and symptomatic treatment. Those with persist-\nent fever, fatigue, and dyspnoea would require\nadmission for full assessment, respiratory support, and\ntargeted anticoagulation by low molecular weight\nheparin to prevent thromboembolic events. Since the\nviral load peaks at the time of symptom onset or presen-\ntation [ 90 ], antiviral treatment is unlikely to work unless\ngiven early when the disease is still mild. Remdesivir has\nbeen shown toshortenthe duration of hospitalization by\n5 days ina randomized controltrialwhich did notmoni-\ntor the serial viral load changes after treatment [ 291 ].\nThe WHO Solidarity trial, a multinational trial with\n11,330 adult patients, found that remdesivir, lopinavir-\nβ ritonaivir, interferon -1a, and hydroxychloroquine,\nﬁ havelittleor noclinical bene t whengiven as monother-\napy, especially when started at the stage of respiratory\nβ failure [ 292 ]. However, a combination of interferon -\n1b, lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin was shown to\nshorten the duration of hospitalization and reduce the\n– viral load by 2 3 log between day 6 and day 11 after\nsymptom onset if given early in a randomized control\nβ trial [ 293 ]. Similarly, inhaled interferon -1a was also\nshown to improve symptoms in mild cases in another\nrandomized control trial without viral load monitoring\n[ 294 ]. This is not unexpected because while SARS-\nCoV-2 is highly susceptible to interferons in vitro , the\nvirus was shown to reduce type 1 interferon produced\nin ex vivo infected lung tissue explant [ 120 , 295 ]. Fur-\nthermore, about 13% of patients with severe COVID-\n19 were found to have high titres of auto-antibody\nagainst type 1 interferons and especially against inter-\nα feron- [ 156 ].\nThough individual or cocktail neutralizing mono-\nclonal antibody treatment has been shown to reduce\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nviral load when given early after symptom onset and\nbefore the appearance of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2\nantibody in non-hospitalized patients [ 296 , 297 ], this\napproach has not yet been shown to reduce morbidity\nand mortality. A clinical trial of a monoclonal anti-\nﬁ body, LY-CoV555, did not show clinical bene t\namong hospitalized patients [ 298 ]. Similarly, conva-\nlescent plasma with neutralizing antibody only\nimproved clinical status of elderly with mild\nCOVID-19 when given within 3 days of symptom\nﬀ onset and was not e ective after hypoxaemia devel-\noped in randomized clinical trials [ 299 ]. Additional\ntreatment trials are still ongoing or being planned to\nﬀ ascertain the clinical e ectiveness of clinically\napproved drugs discovered in drug repurposing\nstudies such as ivermectin, umifenovir, favipiravir,\ncamostat, nafamostat, teicoplanin, and bismuth com-\npounds [ 223 , 300 , 301 ].\nWhile currently available antivirals have not\nﬁ demonstrated survival bene t, several immunomodu-\nlators have been shown to improve survival. Dexa-\nmethasone has been shown to reduce mortality by\nabout 30% in patients requiring oxygen supplemen-\ntation [ 302 , 303 ]. Baricitinib, an inhibitor of Janus\nkinase, was shown to improve survival in patients trea-\nted with remdesivir, with a hazard ratio of death of 0.65\nﬂ [ 304 ]. Con icting or preliminarily positive results\nregarding the use of histamine receptor 2 antagonist\nfamotidine, vitamin D, IL6 inhibitor tocilizumab and\n– colchicine were reported [ 305 307 ]. Fluvoxamine, a\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with high\nﬃ σ a nity for -1 receptor appeared to prevent clinical\ndeterioration when given as early treatment for mild\nCOVID-19 [ 308 ]. An open-labelled randomized trial\nshowed that patients treated with recombinant\nhuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor have a\nlower risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome, sepsis, or septic shock [ 309 ]. Additional\ntherapeutic approach that may include the manipu-\nlation of complement, neutrophil trapping function\nﬁ and TNF function are being discussed. More de nitive\nlarge randomized control treatment trials are needed to\nﬁ con rm the usefulness of these immunomodulators.\nDespite respiratory support by non-invasive venti-\nlation by bilevel positive airway pressure or continu-\nous positive airway pressure, some patients will still\ndeteriorate and necessitate intubation and mechanical\nventilation. In those who failed positive end expiratory\npressure and prone ventilation, extracorporeal mem-\nbrane oxygenation is the last step to support the\npatient till spontaneous recovery [ 310 ].\nPublic health measures\nﬀ We have shown that di erent epidemic waves in Hong\nﬀ Kong Special Administrative Region were due to di er-\nent imported lineages of virus which became dominant\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 521\nduring the epidemic surge and then disappeared with\nsuccessful implementation of epidemiological control\nmeasures. Successful epidemic control depends on\nstopping case importation, minimizing community\ndissemination by social distancing measures, early\ndetection and isolation of cases by extensive testing,\nrapid contact tracing and quarantine, and individual\nprotection by universal masking and diligent hand\nhygiene. The resulting reduction of case load will pro-\ntect our hospital and intensive care unit from paralysis\nandprevent the burnout ofhealthcare workers.Control\nat the border depends on minimizing the number of\nﬂ ights from highly epidemic areas with dangerous\nvirus mutants, and testing all incoming travellers with\nno exemption, enclosed transportation and quarantin-\n– ing them for 14 21 days till negative surveillance test-\ning. During the severe winter epidemic, city and even\nnation-wide lockdown with curfew to prevent gather-\nings is useful to enforce social distancing. The alterna-\ntive way is to close or reduce the time of opening and\noccupancy of high-risk premises such as eateries, bars\nﬁ ﬀ and tness clubs where masks are often taken o .\nWith sporadic clusters, district closure with mandatory\n– RT PCR testing of everyone followed by another test-\n– ing at day 5 14 can be useful in stopping community\ntransmission. Universal masking when outside home\nis demonstrated to stop the asymptomatic infected\nindividual from shedding virus and to prevent suscep-\ntible individuals from acquiring infection as hinted by\nthe hamster model [ 90 ]. Although surgical masks\nﬀ only have a fairly high e ectiveness in blocking aerosols\nin the micron size range [ 311 ], it appears to be nearly as\nﬀ e ective as N95 respirator [ 312 ]. Universal masking is\nshown useful in community epidemiological studies\n[ 313 , 314 ]. Every case of unexplained fever or respirat-\nory symptom should undergo mandatory testing.\nRepeated testing is indicated if the symptom persists\nas false negative may happen. While asymptomatic\ninfection does occur, more than 80% of patients\ndevelop symptoms during the course of illness [ 315 ].\nMoreover, only around 10% of infected persons are\nresponsible for 80% of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nThus catching this 10% by rapid multilayer contact tra-\ncing, early testing and quarantine of close contacts may\nidentify the related asymptomatic or presymptomatic\ncases to stop further transmission. Rapid multilayer\ncontact tracing, including non-close contacts and con-\ntacts of close contacts going back to more than 2 days\nbefore symptom onset, may be value added. Such\nlabour-intensive contact tracing can be facilitated by\nﬁ a trained team with arti cial intelligence analysing\ndata of mobile phone applications or electronic pay-\nment. But these should be conducted in a manner to\nprotect individual privacy [ 316 ]. Timely risk com-\nmunication and education through media and internet\nare extremely important to secure cooperation from\nthe public to make epidemic control a success.\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n522 K. K-W. To et al.\nInfection control\nThe key measures of infection control against nosoco-\nmial outbreaks of COVID-19 include a combination\nﬁ of active surveillance for early case identi cation, iso-\nﬁ lation of suspected and con rmed case in the airborne\ninfection isolation room (AIIR) with the implemen-\ntation of standard, contact, droplets, and airborne pre-\ncautions, as well as contact tracing to identify the\n– potential secondary cases [ 317 320 ]. These infection\nﬀ control measures which had been proven to be e ec-\ntive in controlling SARS in 2003 were not as successful\nfor COVID-19 [ 321 ], because asymptomatic infection\nﬁ contributes to a signi cant part of transmission and\nthat the viral load peaks around the time of symptom\nonset. Thus universal screening of all hospital admis-\n– sions or outpatient attendance by RT PCR is war-\nranted to reduce the risk of healthcare-related\noutbreaks. The risk for nosocomial transmission is\nespecially high when asymptomatic COVID-19\npatients are placed in non-AIIR rooms, or/and put\nﬂ on high- ow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation\n[ 322 ]. Therefore, universal masking for healthcare\nworkers and hospitalized patients, if not medically\ncontraindicated, in the clinical areas should be\nenforced to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission\nby respiratory droplets and short-range airborne route\n[ 323 ]. In fact, universal masking in the clinical areas\ncan achieve zero nosocomial transmission of other\nﬂ ﬂ respiratory viruses such as in uenza A, in uenza B,\nand respiratory syncytial virus [ 324 ]. Universal mask-\ning in the community also reduced the incidence of\nCOVID-19 in the general population [ 325 ].\nThe overwhelming burden of hospitalized COVID-\n19 patients is another risk factor of nosocomial out-\nbreaks. Alternative hospital sites such as temporary\nshelter hospital and convention halls have been built\nor re-purposed in mainland China, Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region, the UK, the USA and\nSingapore as temporary measures to meet sudden\n– surge in COVID-19 [ 326 328 ]. The infection control\nﬂ logistics and work ow in these alternative sites should\nbe carefully planned and implemented to minimize\nthe risk of outbreak [ 327 ]. The ventilation system of\nthese alternative sites, especially the convention hall,\nﬃ was di cult to match with the hospital standard of\n– 6 12 air changes per hour. Another parameter of ven-\ntilation by volume of air per second per person of\naround 60 L/s/person was considered acceptable as\nrecommended by World Health Organization [ 329 ].\nAppropriate use of personal protective equipment\n(PPE) is associated with a decreased risk of COVID-\n19 [ 330 ]. Full PPE includes use of N95 respirator,\ncap, face shield, gloves, and isolation gown of ASTM\n– levels 1 3 were recommended [ 331 ]. However, critical\nshortage of PPE, especially N95 respirator, was a glo-\nbal problem during the initial phase of pandemic\n\n[ 332 ]. Reprocessing of N95 surgical respirator for\nreuse in performing aerosol generating procedures\nwas also supported by the IDSA expert panel [ 333 ].\nThe methods of reprocessing include the use of vapor-\nized, plasma, ionized hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet\nradiation, and steam sterilization [ 333 ]. Quantitative\nﬁ t test of N95 mask was performed to determine the\nmaximum frequency of reprocessing [ 333 ].\nInfection control training for proper donning and\nﬃ do ng of PPE is of utmost importance. Directly\nﬃ observed donning and do ng was promoted to maxi-\nmize the protection and reduce the risk of self-contami-\nnation [ 334 ]. Simulation training has been used to\nenhance competency and alertness of healthcare\nworkers, especially on the performance of high-risk pro-\ncedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ 335 ].\nAnimal models\nSARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from an ancestral bat\nvirus and jumped to humans via an unknown inter-\nmediate host [ 5 ]. SARS-CoV-2-related bat corona-\nviruses have now been found outside China,\nincluding Cambodia [ 336 ], Thailand [ 337 ], and Japan\n[ 338 ]. Over the course of the pandemic, it has become\nincreasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to\ninfect a wide range of animals. Natural human-to-ani-\nmal transmission events involving dogs, cats, lions,\n– tigers, and minks have been reported [ 71 , 339 341 ].\nSurrogate entry assays suggest that the S glycoprotein\nof SARS-CoV-2 has wide tropism for a variety of mam-\nmalian ACE2 receptors [ 342 ]. Therefore, it is not sur-\nﬃ prising that e cient animal models for COVID-19\nﬁ could be rapidly established [ 343 ]. The rst of these\nwas the golden Syrian hamster ( Mesocricetus auratus ),\nﬁ which was quickly identi ed as a suitable model based\non molecular docking analysis of its ACE2 with the\nSARS-CoV-2 RBD [ 89 ]. The clinical features of\nCOVID-19 in human are well replicated in hamsters,\nwhich demonstrate a mild-to-moderate disease course\nwith histopathological evidence of pneumonia. There-\nfore, hamsters are ideally suited to study the pathogen-\nesis of SARS-CoV-2. Viral load dynamics in infected\nhamsters echo those of humans. Hamsters are able to\ntransmit disease to each other via contact or non-con-\ntact transmission, thereby facilitating transmission\nstudies [ 344 ]. The key limitation is the relative paucity\nﬁ ofspeci cantibodies fordetecting hamsterbiomarkers.\nOther small animal models for SARS-CoV-2\nresearch include ferrets ( Mustela putorius furo ) and\nmice ( Mus musculus ). Ferrets have a long pedigree\nﬂ of use in in uenza research and are also susceptible\nto SARS-CoV-2 although the disease phenotype is\nquite mild and predominantly restricted to the upper\nrespiratory tract [ 345 , 346 ]. Given their convenience,\nmice models have also been developed, although this\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nrequires either virus adaptation to mouse ACE2 or\nhumanized ACE2-expressing mice [ 343 ]. These have\nthe disadvantage of modifying the disease phenotype,\nespecially in human-ACE2 transgenic mice which\nhave mild respiratory but severe brain disease.\nDepending on the promotor used, these human\nACE2-transgenic mice exhibit variable phenotypes,\nranging from mild disease to severe disease with ence-\nphalitis and even death [ 347 , 348 ]. Mice humanized\nwith human ACE2 using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin tech-\nnology supports SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respir-\natory tract and brain tissues but generally develop only\nmild to moderate disease [ 349 ]. Adenovirus or adeno-\nassociated virus-transduced mice develop self-limiting\nviral pneumonia, but has the advantages of being easy\nﬀ to generate and could be quickly adapted for di erent\nmouse strains [ 350 , 351 ]. Laboratory rabbits can be\ninfected with asymptomatic virus shedding [ 352 ].\nAs the ultimate origin of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be\nﬃ from bats, one group has also demonstrated e cient\ninfection of a fruit bat model ( Rousettus aegyptiacus )\nwith the virus. Fruit bats showed minimal clinical fea-\ntures of infection, but were capable of transmitting\ninfection [ 353 ]. Notably, pigs and chickens, which\nare in close contact with humans, are not able to sup-\nport productive infection, thus ruling them out as\nintermediate hosts [ 353 , 354 ].\nSmall animal models such as those described above\nﬁ are convenient, but de nitive evaluation of pathogen-\nesis, antivirals and vaccines requires non-human pri-\nmate models. Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ),\ncynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ), African\ngreen monkeys ( Chlorocebus aethiops ), and baboons\n( Papio ) are all susceptible to COVID-19 [ 355 , 356 ].\nDisease in non-human primates is typically mild, but\ndisease severity and viral shedding increases with age\nas in humans.\nVaccines\nﬀ Over 70 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines developed from di er-\nent vaccine technology platforms including inacti-\nvated whole virion, live attenuated virus, nucleic\nacid, virus vectors, and recombinant S protein, are\nalready in clinical trials. Four vaccine candidates\nhave published their phase 3 clinical data. While\nthey all appear safe in clinical trials, each has its merits\nand demerits. The mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines\ninduce good serum neutralizing antibody and cell-\nmediated immunity but requires stringent cold storage\n− − at 20 to 70°C [ 357 ]. Though this is a new technol-\nﬀ ogy, side e ects are generally mild. Rare cases of ana-\nphylaxis, possibly due to polyethylene glycol, have\nbeen reported after millions of doses have been admi-\nnistered [ 358 ]. Concerns of vaccine exacerbation of\nunderlying medical illness in frail elderly aged over\n80 years are not yet substantiated. The chimpanzee\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 523\nadenovirus and human adenovirus 26/5 vectored vac-\ncines also induce high titres of neutralizing antibody\nand strong cell-mediated immunity with at least 70%\nﬃ vaccine e cacy [ 359 , 360 ]. Further analysis of a\nphase 3 clinical trial showed that an adenovirus-vec-\nﬀ tor-based vaccine was more e ective if the interval\nﬁ between the rst and second dose was 12 weeks or\nlonger [ 361 ]. While the phase 3 clinical data from\nthe beta-propiolactone inactivated whole virion vac-\ncine have not yet been published in peer reviewed\njournals, the data from phase 2 trials suggested that\nthe vaccine is safe and can induce neutralizing anti-\nbodies, but the data on cell-mediated immunity is lim-\nited at this stage [ 362 , 363 ]. All three kinds of vaccines\nare likely to prevent severe symptomatic infection, but\nmay not be able to prevent upper airway infection or\ntransmissions, and are not well tested in children or\npregnancy. The saponin-based recombinant trimeric\nspike nanoparticle appears to induce the best serum\nneutralizing antibody and reasonable cell-mediated\nimmunity but phase 3 clinical trial data have not\nbeen published [ 364 ]. However, there are preliminary\nevidence that spike RBD virus mutants from South\nAfrica and Brazil with E484 K mutation may reduce\nthe neutralizing antibody titres induced by these vac-\ncines [ 365 , 366 ]. But as long as these vaccines protect\nvaccine recipients from severe disease, SARS-CoV-2\nmay just become another circulating common cold\ncoronavirus when most of the global population has\ndeveloped herd immunity by natural infections, or\nvaccination against the early Wuhan-related virus\nstrains. Initial animal studies and phase 3 vaccination\ntrials did not reveal any vaccine enhanced disease or\nantibody-dependent disease enhancement [ 367 ].\nInstead, vaccination within 3 days before or after\nvirus challenge in hamsters still showed varying degree\nof protection despite the lack of detectable neutraliz-\ning antibody titre at that juncture [ 367 ]. To maximize\nprotection of the available vaccines, further studies on\nﬀ ﬀ the e ects of prime and boost approach by di erent\ncombinations of vaccines are warranted. With the\nﬀ increasing availability of safe and e ective vaccines,\nﬁ the battle is to ght misinformation and vaccine hesi-\ntancy by strategic education and risk communication\n– so as to achieve a herd immunity of 70 80%.\nEpilogue\nEmerging coronaviruses from animals have caused\n– SARS in 2002 2003, MERS in 2012, and COVID-19\nin 2019. These viruses have probably originated in\nbats and gone through intermediate wild mammals\nbefore jumping into humans. We predicted in 2007\n“ that the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-\nlike viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the cul-\nture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is\na time bomb. The possibility of the reemergence of\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n524 K. K-W. To et al.\nSARS and other novel viruses from animals or labora-\ntories and therefore the need for preparedness should\n” not be ignored [ 368 ]. Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from\nanimals to humans appears to have happened in 2019.\nBut unlike the other two highly pathogenic corona-\nviruses, the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 is able\nﬂ to overwhelm the healthcare system, in ict psycho-\nphysical morbidities and mortalities, and disrupt our\nsocioeconomic activities. More extensive and sus-\ntained animal surveillance for novel coronaviruses,\nmonitoring of their evolution, and assessment of\ntheir risk of species jumping should be performed to\nunderstand the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the intermedi-\nate animal host, and to prepare for the next epidemic.\nThe functions of many NSPs and ORFs of SARS-CoV-\n2, and their roles in viral life cycle and pathogenesis,\nare still uncertain. Unlike SARS which is usually\nquite symptomatic, the viral and immunological\nmechanisms underlying the generally milder symp-\ntoms or lack of symptoms in COVID-19 warrant\nmore investigations. The types of samples and tests\nwhich can provide rapid, inexpensive and accurate\ndiagnosis still need more research and development.\nﬀ With the early peaking of viral load, any e ective anti-\nviral strategy must be able to suppress the viral load\nsharply and coupled with immunomodulatory agents\nin order to improve the clinical outcome. Close moni-\ntoring of viral variants with increased virulence, trans-\nmissibility, and resistance to antivirals, antibodies or\nvaccines is important to combat this pandemic. The\nduration of protection by natural infection or vacci-\nnation, and the relative contribution to protection by\nneutralizing antibody or cell mediated immunity are\nstill uncertain. Understanding the relative importance\nof transmission by droplet, aerosol, contact, and oral\ningestion would provide more evidence to support\nrecommendations on infection control measures and\nbiosecurity standards of markets. Reusable, self-disin-\nﬁ fectable and personalized lter-mask, eye protection,\ngloves and gowns should be developed as essential\ncomponents of an environmental-friendly epidemic\ncombat kit for everyone in the global village. Much\nmore work by a highly coordinated real-time global\nsurveillance network has to be done to win this war\nagainst COVID-19 and further emerging epidemics.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the originating and submitting\nlaboratories who contributed sequences to Global Initiative\nﬂ on Sharing All In uenza Data (GISAID) (Supplementary\nTable S1).\nDisclosure statement\nﬁ JFWC has received travel grants from P zer Corporation\nHong Kong and Astellas Pharma Hong Kong Corporation\nLimited, and was an invited speaker for Gilead Sciences\n\nHong Kong Limited and Luminex Corporation.

The COVID-19 pandemic was\nheralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs,\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The\nﬁ cant pandemic potential. The presence of a large\nreservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with\nthese areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics.

This familial cluster provided clear evidence of\nperson-to-person transmission and inter-city spread\nby air travel. Furthermore, the report of an imported\ncase in Thailand on 13 January 2020, and subsequently\nother countries suggested that global dissemination\nmight have occurred earlier by frequent air travel.\nBy the end of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was\nreported in 31 provinces in China, across East and\nSoutheast Asia, and to Europe and the United States.\nCommunity transmission was detected in other\nAsian countries, a large part of Europe, the Middle\n– East and the United States since February 2020 [ 8\n11 ]. Figure 1 gives a detailed account of the unfolding\nof the pandemic. By April 2020, the total number of\nCOVID-19 cases surpassed 1 million as more and\nmore countries entered partial or nation-wide lock\ndown. The death toll due to COVID-19 reached 1\nmillion on 25 September 2020. By 22 December 2020,\nwith the Chilean army reporting 36 cases at its research\nstation in Antarctica, COVID-19 cases have been\nﬀ reported to a ect all seven continents [ 12 ]. As of 4 Feb-\nruary 2021, there have been more than 103 million\nﬁ con rmed cases with over 2 million deaths [ 13 ].\nTaxonomy, genomic organization, and\nreplication cycle of SARS-CoV-2\nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of\nthe family Coronaviridae . This genus also includes the\nhuman respiratory pathogens SARS-CoV-1, Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV), human coronavirus (HCoV)-HKU1,\nand HCoV-OC43 [ 14 ]. Together with the closely\nrelated bat coronavirus RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-1,\nﬁ SARS-CoV-2 is classi ed as a member of the Sarbecov-\nirus subgenus of SARS-related coronaviruses [ 15 ].\nRapid characterization of SARS-CoV-2 by electron\nﬁ microscopy and NGS con rmed that it shared the\nstructural features and genomic organization of\nother betacoronaviruses [ 6 , 7 ]. It is a pleomorphic\n– enveloped virus (size range: 60 140 nm) studded\nwith distinctive surface spikes. The positive-sense\nsingle-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is\n– around 29 30 kB in size and is organized as methyl-\n’ capped-5 UTR-ORF1a/b-S-ORF3-E-M-ORF6-ORF7a\n’ /b-ORF8-N/ORF9b-ORF10-3 UTR-poly A tail [ 16 ]\n( Table 1 ). One of the earliest published genome,\nhCoV-19/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019 (GISAID acces-\nsion number (EPI_ISL_402119), has a genome size of\nﬁ 29,891 bp. A study using ribosome pro ling tech-\nniques showed the presence of additional upstream\nand internal open reading frames (ORFs) [ 17 ]. The\ngenome lacks the hemagglutinin esterase gene found\nin some other betacoronaviruses. ORF1ab, which\ncomprises two-thirds of the entire genome, encodes\n\na large polyprotein pp1ab, which is proteolytically\ncleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) critical\n′ for viral replication [ 16 ]. Towards the 3 end of the\ngenome, the S, E, M, and N genes encode key struc-\ntural proteins found in the mature virion [ 18 ]. The\nspike (S) glycoprotein forms trimers on the virion sur-\nface and binds to human angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry [ 19 ]. It con-\ntains two subunits S1 and S2 with a polybasic site\nﬀ PRRA at the junction, which enables e ective cleavage\nby furin and other proteases [ 5 ]. This multibasic clea-\nvage site appears to be an important virulence factor\nwhich may enhance virus replication and multiple tis-\nﬂ sue tropism as in the case of avian in uenza A(H5N1)\nvirus [ 20 , 21 ]. Mutations in this site can attenuate\npathogenicity in animal models and may be an attrac-\ntive option for designing live attenuated vaccines [ 21 ].\n’ Another cleavage site, called S2 , is located within the\nS2 region, and is cleaved by the transmembrane serine\nprotease 2 (TMPRSS2) [ 22 ]. S protein contains major\nimmunogenic epitopes, particularly concentrated in\nthe N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding\ndomain (RBD) of the S1 subunit, which are targets\nof neutralizing antibodies. The envelope (E) protein\nlikely forms a viroporin, which is important for virus\nassembly and release, and is also a putative virulence\ndeterminant [ 23 ]. The membrane (M) protein is an\nabundantly expressed structural protein within the\nlipid envelope that is also important for viral morpho-\ngenesis and interferon suppression [ 24 ]. Finally, the\nnucleocapsid protein (N) stabilizes the RNA genome\nin a helical complex [ 25 ] and serves as a key target\nof adaptive immunity. In addition, there are a number\nof accessory proteins, the function of some of which\nremains unknown. ORF3a may function as an inducer\nof apoptosis [ 26 ]. Both ORF6 and ORF8 are involved\nin interferon antagonism while ORF7a may be\n– involved in inhibiting cellular translation [ 27 29 ].\nORF8 can bind to IL-17 receptor A (IL17RA) which\nﬂ may modulate the in ammatory response, and higher\nblood levels of soluble IL17A has been associated with\nmilder disease [ 30 ]. Interestingly, circulating variants\nwith loss-of-function deletions in SARS-CoV-2\nORF3b, ORF7a/7b, and ORF8 have been found, indi-\ncating that these are not absolutely essential for viral\ninfection and may be remnants required for infection\nﬁ – of an unidenti ed intermediate host [ 31 34 ]. ORF9b,\nan accessory protein translated from an alternative\nopen reading frame within the N gene, interacts with\nthe host mitochondrial import receptor protein\nTOM70 and suppresses type I interferon response\n[ 30 , 35 ]. As for ORF10, it appears dispensable for cel-\nlular infection [ 36 , 37 ].\nStages of the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 have\nbeen rapidly inferred from empirical data and extant\nﬁ knowledge of other betacoronaviruses. The rst step\nin cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2 is the binding",

Other entry factors that facilitate attach-\nment or entry include neuropilin-1 [ 40 , 41 ], the tyro-\nsine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) [ 42 ], CD147\n[ 43 ], high-density lipoprotein (HDL) scavenger recep-\ntor B type 1 (SR-B1) [ 44 ], integrins [ 45 , 46 ], angioten-\nsion II receptor 1 (AT1) and vasopressin receptor 2,\nbut their role in natural infection is currently unclear.\nProteases such as surface TMPRSS2 and endosomal\ncathespsin L [ 46 ] cleave the S protein to activate\nSARS-CoV-2 entry by endocytosis and membrane\nfusion [ 22 ]. Within the cell, the virus uncoats to\nrelease its genomic RNA into the cytoplasm for trans-\nlation [ 47 ]. The translated pp1a and pp1ab polypro-\nteins are proteolytically cleaved to individual Nsps,\nmany of which form the replicase-transcriptase com-\nplex [ 48 , 49 ]. These complexes are localized within\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 509\nspecialized double membrane vesicles (DMV).

Pre-activation of S protein by host\nfurin protease may occur before mature viruses are\nreleased from the cell by exocytosis of secretory ves-\nicles. As in other coronaviruses, subgenomic RNAs\nare produced, and most subgenomic RNA consists\n’ of a leader sequence in the 5 untranslated region of\nthe genome and connected to the S gene or other\n’ genes in the 3 end [ 50 ]. Hence, translated viral pro-\n’ teins are more abundant towards the 3 end of the gen-\nﬀ ome, which may a ect the sensitivity of diagnostic\n– assays using them as targets for RT PCR or antigen\ndetection.

As for the putative struc-\n′ tural RNA found in SARS-CoV-2, the 5 UTR has sev-\n– eral stem-loops (SL1 5) which may be involved in\nmediating viral replication as in other betacorona-\nviruses.

The 3 UTR has the s2 m motif, conserved octa-\nnucleotide and many unexpected folds [ 53 ].\nVirus evolution\nThe origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. Recombi-\nnation is a frequent event for the viral subgenus Sarbe-\ncovirus , which contains SARS-CoV, bat SARS related\nCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [ 54 ]. Some studies suggested\nthat the bat SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses are\nrecombinants of lineages related to SARS-CoV and\nSARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 may result from\nrecombinations between these bat SARS related\n\nRole in pathogenesis\nSuppression of interferon response\nInhibit interferon signalling\nInterferon antagonist\n′\nκ Interacts with NF- B-repressing factor to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8)\ninduction, which potentially increase IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of\nﬂ neutrophils and overexuberant host in ammation [ 49 ]\nPotent interferon antagonist\nPotent interferon antagonist\nPotent interferon antagonist\nInduce apoptosis [ 26 ]\nInterferon antagonist [ 33 ]\nMay conduct Ca2+ out of the ERGIC lumen to activate the host\nﬂ in ammasome [ 23 ]\nInhibit type 1 and III interferon production by direct interaction with\nRIG-I/MDA-5 and impeding downstream signalling [ 24 ]\nPotent interferon antagonist (block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear\ntranslocation) [ 29 ]\nInhibit interferon pathway\nInhibit type I interferon [ 35 ]\n]\ncoronavirus and the pangolin SARS related corona-\nvirus [ 55 , 56 ]. However, another study suggested\nthat recombination may not be involved in the gener-\nation of SARS-CoV-2, but the RBD of SARS-CoV-2\nshares the same ancestral trait as bat viruses [ 57 ].\nThe divergence date between SARS-CoV-2 and bat\nsarbecovirus has been estimated to be 1948 [ 57 ].\nﬁ Since its rst detection in humans in December\n2019, many mutations have been found throughout\nthe SARS-CoV-2 genome [ 58 ]. The mutation rate\n− 3 has been estimated to be 1.1 × 10 nucleotide substi-\ntutions per site per year [ 59 ]. The time of origin of\nSARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be late November\n2019 [ 59 ]. The mutation rate is fastest at the S, N,\nORF1ab, ORF3a, and ORF8 genes [ 60 , 61 ].\nIn addition to inter-host genetic diversity, mixed\nviral populations can be present within an individual\npatient. A variant initially present at low frequency\nin an individual can become the predominant viral\npopulation during the course of illness.

        "text": "found to be transmitted to others, and become the pre-\ndominant viral variant in another patient [ 61 ].\nVirus mutations and variants\nﬀ SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into di erent clades and\nlineages ( Figure 2 ). Currently, there are three major\nﬀ nomenclature systems for the di erent clades or\nlineages. The GISAID and Nextstrain systems were\nused since the beginning of the pandemic, and the\nﬁ clades or lineages are de ned by signature mutations.\nThe GISAID clade is currently divided into S, L, and\nﬀ V, and di erent clades carrying the D614G mutation\n(G, GH, GR, GV), and O. The Nextstrain is divided\ninto 19 (A, B) and 20 (A-J) according to the year\nand order when the clade emerged. Although GISAID\nand Nextstrain nomenclatures are useful in under-\nstanding the virus evolution in a macroscopic scale,\nthese systems are not able to delineate more detailed\noutbreak cluster information. The Pango lineage,\nﬁ rst proposed in July 2020, is a dynamic system,\nwhich takes into account whether the lineage is\nactively spreading or not [ 63 , 64 ]. The Pango lineage\nﬁ system has a much ner resolution than GISAID or\nNextstrain, and is particularly useful to capture the\nemergence of novel variants.\nAs the virus evolves, many novel variants have been\nfound. The analysis of viral variants helps epidemiolo-\ngical investigations. For example, whole viral genome\nanalysis during the 2020 summer outbreak in Hong\nKong showed that the outbreak was most likely linked\nto viral variants imported by travellers [ 65 ]. Further-\nmore, variant analysis can be used to identify factors\nﬀ that a ect transmissibility or virulence of the virus.\nIn vitro screening using serial passage or site-directed\nﬁ mutagenesis identi ed mutations in the S protein that\nallow the virus to escape neutralization by convales-\nﬃ cent plasma or infect cells more e ciently [ 66 , 67 ].\nLong-term SARS-CoV-2 shedding in immunocom-\npromised individuals with acquired hypogammaglo-\nbulinemia can lead to a long duration of virus\nshedding and a larger genetic diversity with continu-\nous turnover of dominant viral species throughout\nthe course of infection. Deletion H69 and V70 in the\nS protein NTD was reported in a B-cell depleted\npatient which may be related to selection by convales-\ncent plasma therapy [ 68 ]. Furthermore, remdesivir\nfailure with D484Y mutation at RNA dependent\nRNA-polymerase was also reported in a B-cell immu-\nﬁ node cient patient with protracted SARS-CoV-2\nshedding [ 69 ].\nViral variants can also emerge during circulation in\nanimals. Since SARS-CoV-2 can infect many animals\nnaturally or experimentally [ 70 ], there is always a\ndanger of human-to-animal SARS-CoV-2 trans-\nmission, followed by the genesis of mutants in animals\nwhich then jump back into human. Mink-to-human\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 511\ntransmission has been documented in Europe [ 71 ].\nFurthermore, the S N501Y variant can be selected in\nvirus adaptation experiments using Balb/c mice [ 72 ].\nSeveral notable variants have emerged since the\nbeginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nB.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and P.1\nﬁ (VOC202101/02) which were rst reported from the\nUnited Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively\n[ 73 ]. These variants usually increase transmissibility\nand, thereby, rapidly replace existing lineages. Some\nof these variants share certain critical mutations in\nthe S protein RBD. For example, N501Y is present\nin the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, while E484 K is present\nin the B.1.351 and P.1 in addition to N501Y and\nD614G ( Table 2 ).\nﬁ ﬁ One of the rst major variants identi ed for SARS-\nCoV-2 were deletions at the S protein S1/S2 junction.\nThese were readily seen during passage in Vero E6\ncells [ 21 ]. S1/S2 junction deletion variants have been\nfound to be less virulent in a hamster model [ 21 ]. S1/\nS2 junction deleted variants also naturally exist in\n’ patients samples before any passage in cell cultures[ 74 ].\nORF8 is a unique protein in SARS-CoV-2 [ 16 ] and\nis found to be immunogenic [ 75 ]. However, ORF8-\nﬁ deleted or truncated mutants have been identi ed fre-\nquently. In a Singapore study, patients infected with\nORF8-deleted mutants have milder disease than\nthose infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 [ 31 ].\nORF3b deleted mutants have also emerged with the\nD614G mutation. Truncation of ORF3b confers the\nloss of its function of interferon antagonism [ 32 ].\nD614G mutation was not reported in the initial out-\nbreak in China, but is now found in almost all strains\nglobally. Several studies have evaluated the impact of\nD614G on the SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, they show\nthat D614G variant replicates to a higher titre in vitro\nﬃ and in vivo , and transmits more e ciently, but does\nﬀ ﬁ not a ect disease severity or confer a signi cant change\n– in neutralizing activity of convalescent sera [ 66 , 76 78 ].\nﬀ Mechanistically, D614 mutation a ects the confor-\nﬃ mation of the S protein, which allows more e cient\nbinding to the human ACE2 receptor [ 79 ].\nThere have been multiple outbreaks of SARS-CoV-\n2 infection among mink farms in Europe [ 80 ]. Mink-\nﬁ associated human infections have been identi ed [ 71 ].\nA unique lineage has been found in these mink-associ-\nated human cases from Denmark, including 4\nΔ mutations in the S protein ( 69-70, Y453F, I692 V,\nM1229I). Y453 has been shown to be involved in\nreceptor binding [ 66 ]. Preliminary investigation with\n9 COVID-19 convalescent serum specimens showed\nﬁ a statistically signi cant reduction in neutralizing anti-\nbody titre [ 73 ].\nﬁ The B.1.1.7 variant was rst detected in September\n2020, spread rapidly in south-eastern England by\nDecember, and has become the predominant variant\nin the UK. This variant has increased transmissibility",

In\nﬁ the rst case of reinfection reported in August 2020,\nthe second episode was caused by a D614G variant\n[ 86 ]. In a reinfection case reported from Brazil, the\nsecond episode was caused by the E484 K variant\n[ 87 ]. Virus carrying the E484 K was shown to be less\nsusceptible to neutralization by sera from mRNA vac-\ncine recipients [ 88 ].\nTransmission routes\nSARS-CoV-2 is believed to spread predominantly via\nshort-range airborne aerosol, respiratory droplets,\nand direct or indirect contact with infectious respirat-\nory droplets. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2\nhas been elegantly demonstrated in the hamster\nmodel [ 89 , 90 ]. Low level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (con-\n3 3 centrations in air up to 3.4 × 10 RNA copies per m\nair sampled) could be detected in the air samples\nobtained from the environment housing COVID-19\npatients even in the absence of aerosol-generating pro-\n– cedures [ 91 94 ]. Viable SARS-CoV-2 virus could be\nisolated from air samples collected as far as 4.8 m\naway from COVID-19 patients with estimated viral\n– concentrations of 6 74 TCID units/L of air [ 95 ],\n50\nsubstantiating the hypothesis that aerosol dissemina-\ntion of SARS-CoV-2 may serve as a source of\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 513\ninfection. Large quantities of particles, with the\nmajority of less than 5 microns, can be emitted during\nnormal speech, and the amount is positively correlated\nwith the loudness of vocalization [ 96 ]. Aerobiological\nstudy showed that particles produced in the human\nrespiratory tract represent a continuum of sizes\ninstead of a sharp distinction into respiratory droplet\n≥ ( 5 microns) or airborne aerosol (<5 microns). The\nconcentration of respiratory droplets and airborne\naerosol carrying SARS-CoV-2 should be inversely pro-\nportional to distance from the source patient. Short-\nrange airborne spread should be the predominant\nroute of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nIn addition, contact with frequently touched sur-\nfaces, shared items, and food that are contaminated\nby infectious respiratory droplets likely represent\nanother route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [ 97 ].\nOne study found that 5% of the near-patient environ-\nmental samples contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a\n2 median viral load of 9.2 × 10 copies/mL [ 98 ], with\n’ the highest contamination rates on patients mobile\nﬂ – phones, oors, bed rails and air exhaust vents [ 91\n93 , 98 ]. Though still considered controversial as a por-\ntal of transmission, several outbreaks have been linked\nto contaminated frozen food, their packaging\nmaterials and storage environments [ 99 ]. The half-\n– life of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was 1.7 2.7 days at\n20°C, which is reduced to a few hours at 40°C [ 100 ].\nAt the highest viral load excreted by infectious\npatients, viral particles remained viable for up to 28\ndays at 20°C on common surfaces such as glass, stain-\nless steel, and polymer banknotes [ 100 ]. The relative\nﬀ humidity also a ects the rate of viral decay, which\nwas most rapid at 65% relative humidity and slower\neither at lower (40%) or higher (75%) humidity [ 101 ].\n– Other routes of transmission, including faecal oral,\nﬂ and contact with various body uids including urine,\n– tears, and breast milk, have been postulated [ 102\n106 ]. Indeed, oral SARS-CoV-2 inoculation can estab-\nlish subclinical respiratory infection with virus shed-\nding in the hamster model [ 107 ]. Human vertical or\nperinatal transmission from mother to babies is rare\nbut possible [ 108 ].\nVertical transmissions in high rise buildings by fae-\nﬀ ﬀ cal aerosols through chimney e ect, wake e ect and\nminor leaks in sewage, vent pipes, or light wells were\nﬁ reported [ 109 ]. However, the signi cance of these\nalternative routes of transmission in driving the com-\nmunity epidemic is still unclear.\nEpidemiological characteristics\nThe mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection\n– was 4.0 5.2 days, and incubation period of longer than\n14 days has been reported [ 3 , 110 ].

Heterogeneity\nin infectious disease dynamics, where most individuals\ninfect only a few others while a small subset of the\npopulation is responsible for the majority of new\ncases, is commonplace. Retrospective history from\n135 cases between 21 January and 26 February 2020\nﬁ in Tianjin, China, showed signi cant transmission\nﬃ heterogeneity with a coe cient of dispersion of 0.25\n[ 115 ].

This is similar to the IFR estimate of 0.6%\ninferred using the corrected IFR on the Diamond\nPrincess cruise ship [ 117 ].\nAn important reason for the rapid spread of\nCOVID-19 is the presence of asymptomatic and pre-\nsymptomatic transmission.

Moreover, in con-\ntrast to SARS-CoV-1 patients whose viral load in\nnasopharyngeal aspirates peaked at around day 10 of\nsymptoms [ 121 ], the viral load in the respiratory\nsamples of COVID-19 patients was highest during\nﬁ the rst few days of symptom onset [ 90 ].

Thus out-\nbreaks have been reported as clusters in family\nhomes, restaurants, bars, markets, religious premises,\ncruises, carriers, construction sites, dancing studio,\nschools, nursing homes, and healthcare facilities\n[ 132 ]. Several superspreading events have been high-\nlighted. A British individual who attended a confer-\nence in Singapore in January 2020 has spread the\nvirus across the UK, France, and Japan through the\nexposure at a ski resort, where 13 of the 21 exposed\npeople eventually tested positive [ 133 ]. From late Feb-\nruary to early March 2020, an outbreak associated with\nthe Sunday worshipping event in a church caused\nﬁ 61.3% of the 8162 con rmed COVID-19 in the Repub-\nlic of Korea [ 134 , 135 ]. The outbreak related to an\nindex patient on the Diamond Princess cruise ship\nhas led to the quarantine of the passengers and cruise\nmembers at the Port of Yokohama in Japan, on which\n696 of the 3711 passengers (18.8%) tested positive for\n– SARS-CoV-2 [ 118 ]. In fact, using a susceptible\n– – exposed infectious removed (SEIR) model that inte-\ngrates dynamic mobility networks based on mobile\n“ ” phone data, a small minority of superspreader at\npoints of interest, most notably full-service restau-\nrants, was found to account for a large majority of\nCOVID-19 cases [ 136 ]. Selective implementation of\nﬁ speci c restrictive measures at these critical control\nﬀ points of interest may be most e ective. Hospital out-\nbreaks at wards, dialysis centres, and outpatient clinics\n[ 137 , 138 ] fuel the community outbreaks and vice\nversa which adds to the burden of infection control.\nThe long environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2,\nhigh proportion of asymptomatic or mildly sympto-\nmatic patients, peaking of viral load before or at pres-\nentation and therefore its high transmissibility\nwarrants universal masking, diligent hand hygiene,\nand stringent social distancing measures for the suc-\ncessful control before the herd immunity is built up\nby vaccination.\nHistopathology and pathogenesis of\nCOVID-19\nSARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in multiple organs as\n– shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies [ 139 150 ].\nwith common histopathological features summarized\nin Table 3 . Autopsy showed that pulmonary involve-\nﬀ ment with di use alveolar damage together with\nhyaline membrane formation and pulmonary micro-\nemboli are the most prominent acute histopathologi-\nﬁ cal ndings [ 151 ] ( Figure 3 ). These features were\nﬂ often associated with high in ammatory cytokines\nand increased angiogenesis in fatal cases [ 152 , 153 ].\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 515\nThe hyaline membrane was attributed to an increase\n“ in vascular permeability (termed as bradykinin\n” storm ) and accumulation of hyaluronic acid in the\nalveolar space, leading to trapping of high volume of\nwater [ 154 ]. Moreover, serum autoantibodies directed\nagainst many immunomodulatory proteins including\ncytokines, chemokines, complement activation com-\nponents, and cell surface proteins were found in a\nﬁ high throughput extracellular antigen pro ling study\nwhich may add to the tissue damage by immune com-\nplex deposition and complement [ 155 ]. These auto-\nantibodies may also impair immune function and\nvirological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor sig-\nnalling. The presence of these autoantibodies includ-\ning those against interferons is strongly associated\nwith disease severity [ 156 ].\nAlthough SARS-CoV-1 is more virulent based on in\nvitro studies in terms of replication and cell damage\n[ 142 , 148 ], SARS-CoV-2 appears unique in causing\nendotheliitis [ 152 , 157 ], as evident by viral particles\nin vascular endothelium using electron microscopy\n[ 157 ]. Soluble endothelial markers such as angiopoie-\ntin-2 level are positively correlated with severity of\nCOVID-19 [ 158 ]. Furthermore, endotheliitis increases\npropensity of thromboembolism and multisystem\ninvolvement in COVID-19 patients [ 152 , 157 , 159 ,\n160 ]. Widespread thrombosis could be related to the\nﬂ hyperin ammatory and hypercoagulopathy states,\n“ ” termed as immune-thrombosis [ 160 , 161 ]. Direct\nendothelial injury triggers innate immune response,\nincluding activation of monocytes and complement\npathways, leading to deposition of terminal comp-\nlement components C5b-9 (membrane attack com-\nplex), C4d [ 162 ], and mannose binding lectin\n(MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP) in the\nmicrovasculature [ 163 ]. Complement and endo-\nthelium activation induce the production of von Will-\nebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII), while\nreducing antithrombin and ADAMTS13 activity\n[ 164 ]. Activated neutrophils release neutrophil extra-\n– cellular traps to stabilize microthrombi [ 165 167 ].\nMacro- and micro-vascular thrombosis and intralum-\ninal megakaryocyte are more common features than\nﬁ lymphocytic in ltration of myocardium in patients\nwith cardiac involvement [ 168 ]. In terms of lymphoid\norgan involvement, T-cell depletion occurred in the\nspleen [ 169 ]. Necrosis or atrophy in the lymphoid tis-\nsue of lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen are\ncommonly observed extrapulmonary pathologies\n[ 170 ].\nﬀ COVID-19 may a ect the central nervous system\nﬀ due to indirect e ects of cytokine storm or suspected\ndirect virus invasion.

The\nﬂ endotheliitis and systemic in ammatory response syn-\ndrome with neuronal activation are also postulated to\nexplain the neurological manifestations [ 172 , 173 ].\nAutopsy studies of the brain showed that ischaemic\ninfarct with perivascular microhaemorrhage together\nwith neutrophilic plugs or intravascular microthrombi\n– were common features [ 174 179 ]. Similarly, radio-\nﬂ logical features of vascular in ammation were\nobserved in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of\nﬁ the brain [ 180 ]. T-cell lymphocytic in ltrates were\ncommonly seen at perivascular, parenchymal as well\nas leptomeningeal areas with microglial and astrocyte\nactivation [ 167 , 169 , 175 , 178 , 179 ]. Clinical improve-\nment of encephalopathic symptoms with steroid tends\nﬂ to suggest a dominant role of in ammatory response\n[ 181 ]. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain\nﬂ and cerebrospinal uid by immunohistochemical\n– staining and RT PCR yield inconsistent results\n[ 167 ], as viral RNA detected from brain biopsy may\ncome from vascular endothelium instead of neurons.\nThe localization of S antigen and visualization of\nvirus-like particles at the endothelium were observed\nin some patients with endotheliitis while only few\ncould demonstrate S protein expression in cortical\nﬁ astrocytes [ 174 , 182 ].

Yet SARS-CoV-2 may evade innate immu-\nnity by antagonizing host interferon response. Viral\nproteins that have been shown to antagonize inter-\nferon response include Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp12, Nsp13,\n– Nsp14, Nsp15, ORF3, and ORF6 [ 27 , 142 , 184 186 ].\nFurthermore, the frequency of dendritic cells, T cells,\nﬁ NK cells, and monocytes was signi cantly reduced in\nthe peripheral blood of acute patients when compared\nwith healthy donors [ 187 ]. In particular, decrease in\nlevels of CCR2 expression in dendritic cells may lead\nto poor maturation on stimulation [ 188 ], further redu-\ncing levels of interferons, and hence poor stimulation\nof CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes during acute phase\nﬁ of infection [ 187 ]. Furthermore, in ltration of mono-\nﬂ cytes/macrophages in lungs can increase pro-in am-\nmatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 and\nIP-10, which fuels the cytokine storm [ 189 ]. Th2 cyto-\nkines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, are elevated in patients\nwith severe COVID-19 [ 190 ].\nFor humoral adaptive immune response, most\nﬁ recovered patients develop SARS-CoV-2-speci c\nIgA, IgG, and IgM response not only against S",

The peak antibody response\nappears at around 1 month [ 194 ] and is higher\namong patients with more severe disease [ 195 ]. Most\nstudies showed a static or slow decline in neutralizing\nantibody and IgG response after few months [ 196 ,\n197 ], while IgA and IgM declines more rapidly\n[ 194 ]. One study estimated the half-life of S protein\nIgG to be 140 days [ 198 ]. Notably, some patients\nwho recovered rapidly showed increasing titres over\ntime [ 196 ]. The IgG and IgM levels in saliva correlate\nﬀ with those of serum [ 194 ]. There is also a di erence in\nantibody response between adults and children. While\nadults develop antibody against both N and S proteins\nequally well, children have a stronger anti-S antibody\nﬁ response than anti-N antibody [ 199 ]. S-speci c mem-\nory B lymphocytes showed increase in abundance over\ntime, suggesting that patients can develop rapid anti-\nbody response during reinfection, as was seen in our\npreviously reported reinfection case [ 198 , 200 , 201 ].\nThe exact duration of detectable serum neutralizing\nantibody titre after natural infection or vaccination\nstill awaits long-term follow-up study.\nCases of reinfection have been reported [ 86 ], and\nneutralizing antibody could not be detected at pres-\nentation of the second episode of infection 5 months\nﬁ after the rst episode [ 201 ]. Magnitude and duration\nof persistence of IgG or neutralizing antibody\ncorrelate with severity of COVID-19 in some studies\n[ 193 , 195 ].\nFor cell-mediated adaptive immunity, SARS-CoV-2\nleads to T-cell lymphopenia and functional impair-\nment of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during the\nacute stage [ 187 , 202 ]. Total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells\nare reduced in both mild and severe diseases, but par-\nticularly lower among severe cases [ 203 ]. SARS-CoV-2\nﬁ speci c CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can be detected in\nabout 50% of patients during the acute period and\n>80% of patients in the convalescent stage [ 204 ,\nﬁ 205 ]. The development of SARS-CoV-2 speci c T-\ncell response is impaired among patients with severe\nCOVID-19 [ 204 ]. There is a higher frequency of mem-\nory CD4 than CD8 T-cell responses against N and\nﬁ RBD [ 204 ]. SARS-CoV-2-speci c CD8+ memory T-\ncell responses are directed primarily to the S and M\nproteins especially among those who recovered from\nsevere COVID-19. The levels of T 17 cells were elev-\nH\nated among severe cases [ 206 ]. The frequency of T fol-\nlicular helper cells during the convalescent phase is\nhigher among patients with severe disease than those\nwith milder disease, which correlated with the neutra-\nﬁ lizing antibody titre [ 207 ]. SARS-CoV-2 speci c T-cell\nimmunity can also be found in up to 83% of non-\nCOVID-19 individuals which may suggest some\ncross reactive T-cell immunity that may or may not\n– be protective [ 208 210 ]. Pre-existing memory CD4+\nT cells are cross reactive for SARS-CoV-2 and other\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 517\nﬁ seasonal coronaviruses [ 210 ]. SARS-CoV-2-speci c T\nlymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+) decreased with half-\n– lives of 3 5 months [ 198 ].\nThe overall clinical phenotype of COVID-19 is\ndetermined by the degree of early control of viral\nload by innate and adaptive immune responses, the\nﬂ in ammatory and apoptotic damage of cells triggered\nby the burden of virus, the functional reserve of the\nﬀ a ected organs and the compensatory regenerative\nor reparative power of the host tissues.\nClinical manifestations\nCOVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease which\ncan manifest as acute upper or/and lower respiratory\ntract syndrome of varying severity. The symptom\nonset of COVID-19 is more likely to be gradual\nﬂ than the abrupt onset in in uenza. The patient can\nmanifest with asymptomatic virus shedding, or a\nself-limited syndrome of fever, fatigue, myalgia,\narthralgia, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, and/or conjunc-\ntivitis at one end of the spectrum. But it can also\nprogress to persistent fever, cough, hemoptysis, silent\nhypoxia, chest discomfort or pain, respiratory failure,\nor even multiorgan failure [ 211 , 212 ]. Impairment of\nsmell (hyposmia, anosmia, and parosmia) or taste\n(dysgeusia) has been recognized as important che-\nmosensory disturbances in COVID-19 [ 213 ]. Non-\nconductive olfactory dysfunction (OD) may be the\nsole manifestation [ 214 ]. Other extrapulmonary\nmanifestations include diarrhoea, lymphopenia,\nthrombocytopenia, deranged liver and renal func-\ntion, rhabdomyolysis, meningoencephalitis, stroke,\n– seizure, Guillain Barré syndrome, cardiac arrhyth-\nmia or heart block, pancreatitis, Kawasaki disease\nlike multisystem vasculitis, skin rash or chilblain-\nlike lesions, thromboembolism, and acute thyroiditis\n– [ 215 217 ]. In an analysis of 72314 COVID-19 in\nChina up to 11 February 2020, 81% of the laboratory\nﬁ con rmed patients had mild to moderate illness, 14%\nhad severe disease, and 5% were critically ill requir-\ning intensive care [ 218 ].\nClinical improvement of mild and moderate cases\ngenerally occurs around 10 days after symptom\nonset which coincides with at least 1 log reduction\nof respiratory viral load [ 219 ] and the rise of serum\nantibodies against N or S protein [ 220 ]. However,\nclinical deterioration of moderate disease to respirat-\nory failure may also occur at this time with persistent\nsalivary viral load and increasing lymphopenia in\nthese worsening patients [ 221 , 222 ]. Chest radiograph\nor lung CT scan typically showed bilateral multifocal\nand peripheral ground glass opacities ( Figure 4 )\nwhich may deteriorate to dense consolidation in pro-\ngressive disease [ 223 ].

Patients with X-linked putative\nTLR7 loss of function variant, autoantibody against\ntype 1 interferons, defective mutations of IFNAR2 or\nother interferon signalling genes, antiviral restriction\nenzyme activators (OAS), blood group A and the\nassociated SNPs found by GWAS are associated with\n– ﬀ severe disease [ 226 230 ]. Acute kidney injury a ected\n>20% of hospitalized patients and >50% of those\nrequiring ICU admission, but the rate varies widely\nbetween studies [ 231 ]. The overall crude fatality rate\nﬁ for laboratory con rmed cases is about 2% [ 232 ],\nbut can be as high as 21.9% in patients over 80 years\nof age [ 233 ]. Early bacterial and fungal superinfections\nare uncommon but late superinfections, including\ninvasive pulmonary aspergillosis, were reported in\nthose with prolonged ICU stays and treatment by\nimmunomodulatory agents [ 234 ].\nFollow-up study at 6 months after COVID-19\nsymptom onset showed that over 60% of these patients\nhad persistent symptom of fatigue or muscle weakness\nﬃ [ 235 ]. Sleep di culties (26%), anxiety or depression\n(23%) were not uncommon [ 235 ]. Other symptoms\ninclude smell or taste disorder, palpitations, joint\npain, dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and chest pain\nwhich constitute a constellation of symptoms termed\n“ ” post-acute COVID-19 syndrome . This group of\n“ ” patients are also called COVID long haulers [ 236 ].\nThose with severe disease requiring respiratory sup-\nﬀ port had lung di usion impairment [ 235 ]. However,\nlittle objective evidence of post-acute COVID-19 syn-\ndrome can be found on investigations which bear\nsome similarity to chronic fatigue syndrome or myal-\ngic encephalomyelitis. The cause was speculated to a\ndysregulated immune system which was activated to\nﬁ ght SARS-CoV-2 but failed to dampen down after-\nﬀ wards [ 237 ]. The other di erential diagnoses are either\nan autoimmune process triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or\na persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection which cannot be\neasily detected by conventional testing [ 238 ]. The\nrelationship between the presence of serum autoanti-\nbodies and the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome\nrequires further investigations.\nIn general, children have a shorter and milder\ndisease than adults [ 239 , 240 ]. However, a rare but\nlife-threatening Kawasaki-like disease, known as\nﬂ multisystem in ammatory syndrome in children\nﬂ (MIS-C) or paediatric in ammatory syndrome tem-\nporally associated with SARS-CoV-2, are seen\nduring the convalescent phase of the illness [ 97 ,\n241 ]. Children with MIS-C are usually older, has a\nlower lymphocyte and platelet count, and a higher\nlevel of CRP and ferritin than those with Kawasaki\ndisease [ 242 ].\n\nLaboratory diagnosis\nOne of the most important aspects in curbing the\nspread of the virus and improving the prognosis is\nrapid yet accurate diagnosis of infection followed by\ntimely isolation, contact tracing and treatment. Mol-\necular testing is now the mainstay of diagnosis, sup-\nplemented by point-of- care antigen testing (POCT)\n[ 243 ]. Antibody detection aids in assessment of immu-\nnity, contact tracing, and disease prevalence in the\npopulation. A multitude of diagnostic platforms,\nboth in-house and on commercial platforms, are\ndeveloped to meet these demands [ 244 ].\nSpecimen collection\nViral load in the respiratory tract is highest at or soon\nafter symptom onset [ 222 ], and it decreases at a rate of\n1 log per week [ 90 ]. Testing nasopharyngeal aspirate,\n10\nnasopharyngeal swab, or throat swab is adequate for\nearly-stage infection, especially asymptomatic or\nmild upper respiratory tract infections. Patients with\nlower respiratory tract symptoms should send sputum\nto enhance sensitivity [ 245 ]. Though broncho-alveolar\nlavage (BAL) showed the highest positive rate among\nﬀ di erent respiratory specimens, it is only indicated\nin those with severe lower respiratory tract involve-\nment when the nasopharyngeal and throat specimens\nare tested negative [ 246 ]. Posterior oropharyngeal\nsecretion (POS) or deep throat saliva is increasingly\nstudied as it represents a pooling of posterior naso-\npharyngeal, oropharyngeal and lower respiratory\nsecretions during the supine position during sleep,\nwhen taken in the early morning before breakfast\nand mouth rinsing [ 90 , 247 ]. It can be self-collected\nby patients with instructions, reducing patient dis-\ncomfort, circumventing swab shortage, and minimiz-\ning aerosol exposure for health care professionals.\nThe cost of collecting POS could be 2.59-fold lower\nthan nasopharyngeal specimen [ 248 ]. The sensitivity\nis comparable with nasopharyngeal swab in properly\n– collected specimens by cooperative patients [ 249\n252 ] . The sensitivity does not vary much between\nearly morning and at least 2 h after meal [ 253 ].\n– For non-airway specimens, viral shedding by RT\nPCR was found in faecal material in 40.5% of patients\nﬁ after the rst week of symptom onset and could per-\nsist for 3 weeks or more [ 254 ]. Presence of viral RNA\nﬀ in the sewage system may provide a cost-e ective and\nnon-invasive way of monitoring the disease spread\nwithin the community and may serve as an early\nwarning system for population that lacks access to\nﬃ healthcare [ 255 ]. Enveloped virus has a nity to bio-\nsolids which may allow testing of sludge at sewage\ntreatment plants with better sensitivity than testing\nﬂ in uent [ 256 ]. Composite sampling is used in most\nstudies [ 257 ]. Sewage sample should be concentrated",

Viral RNA can also\nbe detected in the blood in about 30% of severe\npatients, but the detection rate is much lower in\nmilder cases [ 90 , 246 ]. Even without ocular symp-\ntoms, the conjunctival secretion may contain a\nsmall amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in around 8%\nof patients [ 258 ]. Viral RNA is rarely found in the\nurine [ 246 ].\nTo accommodate the large amount of specimen for\nscreening asymptomatic population, pooling of clini-\n– cal specimens, up to 5 30 samples per pool [ 259 ,\n260 ], is an additional strategy to cope with reagent\nshortages, at the expense of possibly longer processing\ntime and reduced diagnostic sensitivity of the weakly\nﬃ positive sample [ 261 ]. It is e cient only when the\nexpected positive sample number is low as positive\npool requires individual retesting [ 262 ]. Strategic\nﬁ retesting of a de ned group [ 263 ] and the use of math-\nematical models to stratify pool size by age groups\nbased on their respective disease prevalence may\nﬃ improve e ciency [ 264 ].\nMolecular testing\nReverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction\n– (RT PCR) is the most widely used technique. Poten-\ntial molecular targets for SARS-CoV-2 include struc-\ntural proteins (e.g. S, E, helicase (hel), N, M and\nnon-structural regions such as the RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase region (Rdrp), and other ORF1ab\ntargets [ 52 , 265 , 266 ]. There is currently no consen-\nsus on which gene confers the best diagnostic per-\nformance. Presently, one bat SARS related CoV\nﬁ conserved and one SARS-CoV-2 speci c target\nﬀ regions are recommended to mitigate e ect of ran-\ndom mutation or genetic drift while maintaining\nﬁ ﬀ speci city [ 265 ]. However, mutations can a ect the\n– sensitivity of detection by RT PCR. For example,\nmutations in the S gene of the UK variant B.1.1.7\n– has led to the failure of some RT PCR primers tar-\ngeting the S gene [ 267 ].\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 519\nTypical changes of COVID-19 pneumonia on lung computed tomography showing bilateral multifocal patchy ground\nHigh throughput and automated commercial plat-\nforms have been developed for molecular SARS-\nCoV-2 diagnosis. Molecular POCT enables rapid test-\ning near the site of collection in areas with little labora-\ntory support [ 249 ]. To improve diagnostic sensitivities\nof molecular assays, clustered regularly interspaced\nshort palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based technology\nhas been employed by coupling with Cas enzyme\n[ 268 ]. Target enrichment sequencing by NGS with\nnanopore or Illumina technology can unravel the\nentire genome within a few days. Sharing of genetic\ndata facilitates tracking of disease spread, understand-\ning of disease transmission route, monitoring of viral\ngenome evolution and detecting novel variants.\nAntigen detection\nN is abundantly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 and is thus\nwidely used as the target for COVID-19 antigen test\n[ 269 ]. Detection is achieved by capturing viral antigen\nﬁ in clinical specimens by monoclonal antibodies xed\non a membrane in colorimetric lateral immunoassays.\nThough this assay can be delivered as POCT in an out-\npatient or even non-healthcare setting, it has low sen-\n– sitivity when compared with RT PCR assays\nespecially for samples with low viral load. In general,\nantigen test is negative when their Ct values on quan-\n– titative RT PCR are more than 25, although the Ct\nﬀ values vary with di erent assays and conditions [ 270 ].\nAntibody detection\nWhile antibody testing is generally not useful for acute\nmanagement, it can be used for retrospective diagnosis\nand seroprevalence study to understand herd immunity\nﬂ [ 271 ]. Commonly employed techniques are lateral ow,\nﬂ chemiluminescent, immuno uorescent, and enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assays [ 272 , 273 ]. Median sero-\nconversion times following symptom onset are 11 days\nfor total antibodies, 12 and 14 days for IgM and IgG\n– respectively [ 220 ]. After 14 days, 56 97% of patients\n– develop IgM and 91 100% of patients develop IgG",

IgM peaks at around 3 weeks\nafter symptom onset and falls to baseline level after\nday 36 [ 276 ]. The duration of IgG or neutralizing anti-\nbody positivity remains controversial. Some study\nshowed decrease in neutralizing antibody titre within\n3 months after symptom onset, while others showed\nno such decrease [ 200 ]. Antibody development against\nS and N protein is comparable by 1 month after infec-\ntion [ 277 ]. Titre of anti-S or anti-S RBD antibody may\nﬂ better re ect protection against reinfection [ 277 ].\nTraditional neutralization assay requires manipu-\nlation of live virus and necessitate biosafety level 3 lab-\noratories. Pseudovirus neutralization assay using\nvesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing S protein\nof SARS-CoV-2 containing the RBD, can be used in\nbiosafety level 2 facilities [ 278 ]. Neutralizing antibodies\nare directed towards the RBD and NTD. Both sites are\nsituated at the tip of the S protein. Surrogate virus neu-\ntralization assay based on antibody-mediated blockage\nof RBD-ACE2 interaction has been developed [ 279 ].\nStudies have shown serological cross-reactivity\nbetween SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with decreas-\ning frequency of cross-reaction from N protein, S\nprotein to RBD domain by enzyme immunoassay\nﬁ [ 52 , 280 ], with no signi cant cross neutralization\n[ 281 ]. Cross-reactivity against other seasonal human\ncoronaviruses in SARS-CoV-2 infection has been\nshown as well, though intensity is not as great as\nthat with SARS-CoV [ 52 , 281 , 282 ].\nAntibody test has also been used to assess whether\nSARS-CoV-2 has circulated in the population before\nthe isolation of the virus. A study from Italy reported\nthat anti-RBDantibody could be found in bloodsamples\ncollected as early as September 2019 [ 283 ]. In the United\nStates, 106 of 7389 of residual specimens from blood\ndonors collected between 13 December 2019and 17Jan-\nuary 2020, tested positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2,\nand neutralizing antibody was detected in 84 of 90 of\nthese samples [ 284 ]. Though these studies suggest that\nCOVID-19 may have emerged much earlier than the\nﬁ – ﬁ rst RT PCR con rmed case, the possibility of EIA\ncross-reactivity with other coronaviruses cannot be\nexcluded.\nViral culture\nInfectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens\ncan only be demonstrated by cell culture assays in bio-\nsafety level 3 facilities. Furthermore, cell culture is\nessential for the evaluation of potential antiviral com-\npounds and vaccines [ 285 ]. Viral culture turned nega-\ntive in 97% of patients by 10 days after symptom onset,\ncoinciding with the time of seroconversion [ 286 ]. Dur-\nation of live virus shedding is believed to be even\nshorter in faecal specimen [ 287 ]. Shedding is prolonged\nin severe and immunocompromised cases [ 288 ].\n\nVero E6 cells which have abundant ACE2\nexpression are commonly used for virus isolation\n[ 142 ]. Vero E6 cell line that expresses TMRPSS2 can\nresult in better culture yield and reduce the likelihood\nof in vitro selection of S1/S2 junction site deletion\nmutant [ 289 , 290 ]. SARS-CoV-2 also grows in\nhuman continuous cell lines such as Calu3 (lung can-\ncer), Huh7 (liver cancer) and Caco2 (colonic cancer)\n[ 142 ]. It grows modestly on U251 (glioblastoma)\nwhich is not seen with SARS-CoV-1 [ 142 ]. Organoid\nsystems such as bat and human intestinal organoids\nare susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and are developed to\nbetter study tissue tropism, the dynamics of infection\nand testing of therapeutic targets. SARS-CoV-2 is suc-\ncessfully cultured in human intestinal organoids from\na stool specimen with high C value of 33.6, demonstrat-\nt\ning possible enteric infection by oro-faecal route [ 141 ].\nTreatment\nExcept in places where all infected cases are legally\nrequired for mandatory hospital isolation, most patients\nwith mild symptoms require only home isolation, moni-\ntoring, and symptomatic treatment. Those with persist-\nent fever, fatigue, and dyspnoea would require\nadmission for full assessment, respiratory support, and\ntargeted anticoagulation by low molecular weight\nheparin to prevent thromboembolic events. Since the\nviral load peaks at the time of symptom onset or presen-\ntation [ 90 ], antiviral treatment is unlikely to work unless\ngiven early when the disease is still mild. Remdesivir has\nbeen shown toshortenthe duration of hospitalization by\n5 days ina randomized controltrialwhich did notmoni-\ntor the serial viral load changes after treatment [ 291 ].\nThe WHO Solidarity trial, a multinational trial with\n11,330 adult patients, found that remdesivir, lopinavir-\nβ ritonaivir, interferon -1a, and hydroxychloroquine,\nﬁ havelittleor noclinical bene t whengiven as monother-\napy, especially when started at the stage of respiratory\nβ failure [ 292 ]. However, a combination of interferon -\n1b, lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin was shown to\nshorten the duration of hospitalization and reduce the\n– viral load by 2 3 log between day 6 and day 11 after\nsymptom onset if given early in a randomized control\nβ trial [ 293 ]. Similarly, inhaled interferon -1a was also\nshown to improve symptoms in mild cases in another\nrandomized control trial without viral load monitoring\n[ 294 ]. This is not unexpected because while SARS-\nCoV-2 is highly susceptible to interferons in vitro , the\nvirus was shown to reduce type 1 interferon produced\nin ex vivo infected lung tissue explant [ 120 , 295 ]. Fur-\nthermore, about 13% of patients with severe COVID-\n19 were found to have high titres of auto-antibody\nagainst type 1 interferons and especially against inter-\nα feron- [ 156 ].\nThough individual or cocktail neutralizing mono-\nclonal antibody treatment has been shown to reduce",

Similarly, conva-\nlescent plasma with neutralizing antibody only\nimproved clinical status of elderly with mild\nCOVID-19 when given within 3 days of symptom\nﬀ onset and was not e ective after hypoxaemia devel-\noped in randomized clinical trials [ 299 ]. Additional\ntreatment trials are still ongoing or being planned to\nﬀ ascertain the clinical e ectiveness of clinically\napproved drugs discovered in drug repurposing\nstudies such as ivermectin, umifenovir, favipiravir,\ncamostat, nafamostat, teicoplanin, and bismuth com-\npounds [ 223 , 300 , 301 ].\nWhile currently available antivirals have not\nﬁ demonstrated survival bene t, several immunomodu-\nlators have been shown to improve survival. Dexa-\nmethasone has been shown to reduce mortality by\nabout 30% in patients requiring oxygen supplemen-\ntation [ 302 , 303 ]. Baricitinib, an inhibitor of Janus\nkinase, was shown to improve survival in patients trea-\nted with remdesivir, with a hazard ratio of death of 0.65\nﬂ [ 304 ]. Con icting or preliminarily positive results\nregarding the use of histamine receptor 2 antagonist\nfamotidine, vitamin D, IL6 inhibitor tocilizumab and\n– colchicine were reported [ 305 307 ]. Fluvoxamine, a\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with high\nﬃ σ a nity for -1 receptor appeared to prevent clinical\ndeterioration when given as early treatment for mild\nCOVID-19 [ 308 ]. An open-labelled randomized trial\nshowed that patients treated with recombinant\nhuman granulocyte colony stimulating factor have a\nlower risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome, sepsis, or septic shock [ 309 ]. Additional\ntherapeutic approach that may include the manipu-\nlation of complement, neutrophil trapping function\nﬁ and TNF function are being discussed. More de nitive\nlarge randomized control treatment trials are needed to\nﬁ con rm the usefulness of these immunomodulators.\nDespite respiratory support by non-invasive venti-\nlation by bilevel positive airway pressure or continu-\nous positive airway pressure, some patients will still\ndeteriorate and necessitate intubation and mechanical\nventilation. In those who failed positive end expiratory\npressure and prone ventilation, extracorporeal mem-\nbrane oxygenation is the last step to support the\npatient till spontaneous recovery [ 310 ].\nPublic health measures\nﬀ We have shown that di erent epidemic waves in Hong\nﬀ Kong Special Administrative Region were due to di er-\nent imported lineages of virus which became dominant\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 521\nduring the epidemic surge and then disappeared with\nsuccessful implementation of epidemiological control\nmeasures. Successful epidemic control depends on\nstopping case importation, minimizing community\ndissemination by social distancing measures, early\ndetection and isolation of cases by extensive testing,\nrapid contact tracing and quarantine, and individual\nprotection by universal masking and diligent hand\nhygiene. The resulting reduction of case load will pro-\ntect our hospital and intensive care unit from paralysis\nandprevent the burnout ofhealthcare workers.Control\nat the border depends on minimizing the number of\nﬂ ights from highly epidemic areas with dangerous\nvirus mutants, and testing all incoming travellers with\nno exemption, enclosed transportation and quarantin-\n– ing them for 14 21 days till negative surveillance test-\ning. During the severe winter epidemic, city and even\nnation-wide lockdown with curfew to prevent gather-\nings is useful to enforce social distancing. The alterna-\ntive way is to close or reduce the time of opening and\noccupancy of high-risk premises such as eateries, bars\nﬁ ﬀ and tness clubs where masks are often taken o .\nWith sporadic clusters, district closure with mandatory\n– RT PCR testing of everyone followed by another test-\n– ing at day 5 14 can be useful in stopping community\ntransmission. Universal masking when outside home\nis demonstrated to stop the asymptomatic infected\nindividual from shedding virus and to prevent suscep-\ntible individuals from acquiring infection as hinted by\nthe hamster model [ 90 ]. Although surgical masks\nﬀ only have a fairly high e ectiveness in blocking aerosols\nin the micron size range [ 311 ], it appears to be nearly as\nﬀ e ective as N95 respirator [ 312 ]. Universal masking is\nshown useful in community epidemiological studies\n[ 313 , 314 ]. Every case of unexplained fever or respirat-\nory symptom should undergo mandatory testing.\nRepeated testing is indicated if the symptom persists\nas false negative may happen. While asymptomatic\ninfection does occur, more than 80% of patients\ndevelop symptoms during the course of illness [ 315 ].\nMoreover, only around 10% of infected persons are\nresponsible for 80% of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nThus catching this 10% by rapid multilayer contact tra-\ncing, early testing and quarantine of close contacts may\nidentify the related asymptomatic or presymptomatic\ncases to stop further transmission. Rapid multilayer\ncontact tracing, including non-close contacts and con-\ntacts of close contacts going back to more than 2 days\nbefore symptom onset, may be value added. Such\nlabour-intensive contact tracing can be facilitated by\nﬁ a trained team with arti cial intelligence analysing\ndata of mobile phone applications or electronic pay-\nment. But these should be conducted in a manner to\nprotect individual privacy [ 316 ]. Timely risk com-\nmunication and education through media and internet\nare extremely important to secure cooperation from\nthe public to make epidemic control a success.",

        "text": "522 K. K-W. To et al.\nInfection control\nThe key measures of infection control against nosoco-\nmial outbreaks of COVID-19 include a combination\nﬁ of active surveillance for early case identi cation, iso-\nﬁ lation of suspected and con rmed case in the airborne\ninfection isolation room (AIIR) with the implemen-\ntation of standard, contact, droplets, and airborne pre-\ncautions, as well as contact tracing to identify the\n– potential secondary cases [ 317 320 ]. These infection\nﬀ control measures which had been proven to be e ec-\ntive in controlling SARS in 2003 were not as successful\nfor COVID-19 [ 321 ], because asymptomatic infection\nﬁ contributes to a signi cant part of transmission and\nthat the viral load peaks around the time of symptom\nonset. Thus universal screening of all hospital admis-\n– sions or outpatient attendance by RT PCR is war-\nranted to reduce the risk of healthcare-related\noutbreaks. The risk for nosocomial transmission is\nespecially high when asymptomatic COVID-19\npatients are placed in non-AIIR rooms, or/and put\nﬂ on high- ow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation\n[ 322 ]. Therefore, universal masking for healthcare\nworkers and hospitalized patients, if not medically\ncontraindicated, in the clinical areas should be\nenforced to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission\nby respiratory droplets and short-range airborne route\n[ 323 ]. In fact, universal masking in the clinical areas\ncan achieve zero nosocomial transmission of other\nﬂ ﬂ respiratory viruses such as in uenza A, in uenza B,\nand respiratory syncytial virus [ 324 ]. Universal mask-\ning in the community also reduced the incidence of\nCOVID-19 in the general population [ 325 ].\nThe overwhelming burden of hospitalized COVID-\n19 patients is another risk factor of nosocomial out-\nbreaks. Alternative hospital sites such as temporary\nshelter hospital and convention halls have been built\nor re-purposed in mainland China, Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region, the UK, the USA and\nSingapore as temporary measures to meet sudden\n– surge in COVID-19 [ 326 328 ]. The infection control\nﬂ logistics and work ow in these alternative sites should\nbe carefully planned and implemented to minimize\nthe risk of outbreak [ 327 ]. The ventilation system of\nthese alternative sites, especially the convention hall,\nﬃ was di cult to match with the hospital standard of\n– 6 12 air changes per hour. Another parameter of ven-\ntilation by volume of air per second per person of\naround 60 L/s/person was considered acceptable as\nrecommended by World Health Organization [ 329 ].\nAppropriate use of personal protective equipment\n(PPE) is associated with a decreased risk of COVID-\n19 [ 330 ]. Full PPE includes use of N95 respirator,\ncap, face shield, gloves, and isolation gown of ASTM\n– levels 1 3 were recommended [ 331 ]. However, critical\nshortage of PPE, especially N95 respirator, was a glo-\nbal problem during the initial phase of pandemic\n\n[ 332 ]. Reprocessing of N95 surgical respirator for\nreuse in performing aerosol generating procedures\nwas also supported by the IDSA expert panel [ 333 ].\nThe methods of reprocessing include the use of vapor-\nized, plasma, ionized hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet\nradiation, and steam sterilization [ 333 ]. Quantitative\nﬁ t test of N95 mask was performed to determine the\nmaximum frequency of reprocessing [ 333 ].\nInfection control training for proper donning and\nﬃ do ng of PPE is of utmost importance. Directly\nﬃ observed donning and do ng was promoted to maxi-\nmize the protection and reduce the risk of self-contami-\nnation [ 334 ]. Simulation training has been used to\nenhance competency and alertness of healthcare\nworkers, especially on the performance of high-risk pro-\ncedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ 335 ].\nAnimal models\nSARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from an ancestral bat\nvirus and jumped to humans via an unknown inter-\nmediate host [ 5 ]. SARS-CoV-2-related bat corona-\nviruses have now been found outside China,\nincluding Cambodia [ 336 ], Thailand [ 337 ], and Japan\n[ 338 ]. Over the course of the pandemic, it has become\nincreasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to\ninfect a wide range of animals. Natural human-to-ani-\nmal transmission events involving dogs, cats, lions,\n– tigers, and minks have been reported [ 71 , 339 341 ].\nSurrogate entry assays suggest that the S glycoprotein\nof SARS-CoV-2 has wide tropism for a variety of mam-\nmalian ACE2 receptors [ 342 ]. Therefore, it is not sur-\nﬃ prising that e cient animal models for COVID-19\nﬁ could be rapidly established [ 343 ]. The rst of these\nwas the golden Syrian hamster ( Mesocricetus auratus ),\nﬁ which was quickly identi ed as a suitable model based\non molecular docking analysis of its ACE2 with the\nSARS-CoV-2 RBD [ 89 ]. The clinical features of\nCOVID-19 in human are well replicated in hamsters,\nwhich demonstrate a mild-to-moderate disease course\nwith histopathological evidence of pneumonia. There-\nfore, hamsters are ideally suited to study the pathogen-\nesis of SARS-CoV-2. Viral load dynamics in infected\nhamsters echo those of humans. Hamsters are able to\ntransmit disease to each other via contact or non-con-\ntact transmission, thereby facilitating transmission\nstudies [ 344 ]. The key limitation is the relative paucity\nﬁ ofspeci cantibodies fordetecting hamsterbiomarkers.\nOther small animal models for SARS-CoV-2\nresearch include ferrets ( Mustela putorius furo ) and\nmice ( Mus musculus ). Ferrets have a long pedigree\nﬂ of use in in uenza research and are also susceptible\nto SARS-CoV-2 although the disease phenotype is\nquite mild and predominantly restricted to the upper\nrespiratory tract [ 345 , 346 ]. Given their convenience,\nmice models have also been developed, although this",

These have\nthe disadvantage of modifying the disease phenotype,\nespecially in human-ACE2 transgenic mice which\nhave mild respiratory but severe brain disease.\nDepending on the promotor used, these human\nACE2-transgenic mice exhibit variable phenotypes,\nranging from mild disease to severe disease with ence-\nphalitis and even death [ 347 , 348 ]. Mice humanized\nwith human ACE2 using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin tech-\nnology supports SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respir-\natory tract and brain tissues but generally develop only\nmild to moderate disease [ 349 ]. Adenovirus or adeno-\nassociated virus-transduced mice develop self-limiting\nviral pneumonia, but has the advantages of being easy\nﬀ to generate and could be quickly adapted for di erent\nmouse strains [ 350 , 351 ]. Laboratory rabbits can be\ninfected with asymptomatic virus shedding [ 352 ].\nAs the ultimate origin of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be\nﬃ from bats, one group has also demonstrated e cient\ninfection of a fruit bat model ( Rousettus aegyptiacus )\nwith the virus. Fruit bats showed minimal clinical fea-\ntures of infection, but were capable of transmitting\ninfection [ 353 ]. Notably, pigs and chickens, which\nare in close contact with humans, are not able to sup-\nport productive infection, thus ruling them out as\nintermediate hosts [ 353 , 354 ].\nSmall animal models such as those described above\nﬁ are convenient, but de nitive evaluation of pathogen-\nesis, antivirals and vaccines requires non-human pri-\nmate models. Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ),\ncynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ), African\ngreen monkeys ( Chlorocebus aethiops ), and baboons\n( Papio ) are all susceptible to COVID-19 [ 355 , 356 ].\nDisease in non-human primates is typically mild, but\ndisease severity and viral shedding increases with age\nas in humans.\nVaccines\nﬀ Over 70 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines developed from di er-\nent vaccine technology platforms including inacti-\nvated whole virion, live attenuated virus, nucleic\nacid, virus vectors, and recombinant S protein, are\nalready in clinical trials. Four vaccine candidates\nhave published their phase 3 clinical data. While\nthey all appear safe in clinical trials, each has its merits\nand demerits. The mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines\ninduce good serum neutralizing antibody and cell-\nmediated immunity but requires stringent cold storage\n− − at 20 to 70°C [ 357 ]. Though this is a new technol-\nﬀ ogy, side e ects are generally mild. Rare cases of ana-\nphylaxis, possibly due to polyethylene glycol, have\nbeen reported after millions of doses have been admi-\nnistered [ 358 ]. Concerns of vaccine exacerbation of\nunderlying medical illness in frail elderly aged over\n80 years are not yet substantiated. The chimpanzee\n\nEmerging Microbes & Infections 523\nadenovirus and human adenovirus 26/5 vectored vac-\ncines also induce high titres of neutralizing antibody\nand strong cell-mediated immunity with at least 70%\nﬃ vaccine e cacy [ 359 , 360 ]. Further analysis of a\nphase 3 clinical trial showed that an adenovirus-vec-\nﬀ tor-based vaccine was more e ective if the interval\nﬁ between the rst and second dose was 12 weeks or\nlonger [ 361 ]. While the phase 3 clinical data from\nthe beta-propiolactone inactivated whole virion vac-\ncine have not yet been published in peer reviewed\njournals, the data from phase 2 trials suggested that\nthe vaccine is safe and can induce neutralizing anti-\nbodies, but the data on cell-mediated immunity is lim-\nited at this stage [ 362 , 363 ]. All three kinds of vaccines\nare likely to prevent severe symptomatic infection, but\nmay not be able to prevent upper airway infection or\ntransmissions, and are not well tested in children or\npregnancy. The saponin-based recombinant trimeric\nspike nanoparticle appears to induce the best serum\nneutralizing antibody and reasonable cell-mediated\nimmunity but phase 3 clinical trial data have not\nbeen published [ 364 ]. However, there are preliminary\nevidence that spike RBD virus mutants from South\nAfrica and Brazil with E484 K mutation may reduce\nthe neutralizing antibody titres induced by these vac-\ncines [ 365 , 366 ]. But as long as these vaccines protect\nvaccine recipients from severe disease, SARS-CoV-2\nmay just become another circulating common cold\ncoronavirus when most of the global population has\ndeveloped herd immunity by natural infections, or\nvaccination against the early Wuhan-related virus\nstrains. Initial animal studies and phase 3 vaccination\ntrials did not reveal any vaccine enhanced disease or\nantibody-dependent disease enhancement [ 367 ].\nInstead, vaccination within 3 days before or after\nvirus challenge in hamsters still showed varying degree\nof protection despite the lack of detectable neutraliz-\ning antibody titre at that juncture [ 367 ]. To maximize\nprotection of the available vaccines, further studies on\nﬀ ﬀ the e ects of prime and boost approach by di erent\ncombinations of vaccines are warranted. With the\nﬀ increasing availability of safe and e ective vaccines,\nﬁ the battle is to ght misinformation and vaccine hesi-\ntancy by strategic education and risk communication\n– so as to achieve a herd immunity of 70 80%.\nEpilogue\nEmerging coronaviruses from animals have caused\n– SARS in 2002 2003, MERS in 2012, and COVID-19\nin 2019. These viruses have probably originated in\nbats and gone through intermediate wild mammals\nbefore jumping into humans.

Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from\nanimals to humans appears to have happened in 2019.\nBut unlike the other two highly pathogenic corona-\nviruses, the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 is able\nﬂ to overwhelm the healthcare system, in ict psycho-\nphysical morbidities and mortalities, and disrupt our\nsocioeconomic activities. More extensive and sus-\ntained animal surveillance for novel coronaviruses,\nmonitoring of their evolution, and assessment of\ntheir risk of species jumping should be performed to\nunderstand the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the intermedi-\nate animal host, and to prepare for the next epidemic.\nThe functions of many NSPs and ORFs of SARS-CoV-\n2, and their roles in viral life cycle and pathogenesis,\nare still uncertain. Unlike SARS which is usually\nquite symptomatic, the viral and immunological\nmechanisms underlying the generally milder symp-\ntoms or lack of symptoms in COVID-19 warrant\nmore investigations. The types of samples and tests\nwhich can provide rapid, inexpensive and accurate\ndiagnosis still need more research and development.\nﬀ With the early peaking of viral load, any e ective anti-\nviral strategy must be able to suppress the viral load\nsharply and coupled with immunomodulatory agents\nin order to improve the clinical outcome. Close moni-\ntoring of viral variants with increased virulence, trans-\nmissibility, and resistance to antivirals, antibodies or\nvaccines is important to combat this pandemic. The\nduration of protection by natural infection or vacci-\nnation, and the relative contribution to protection by\nneutralizing antibody or cell mediated immunity are\nstill uncertain. Understanding the relative importance\nof transmission by droplet, aerosol, contact, and oral\ningestion would provide more evidence to support\nrecommendations on infection control measures and\nbiosecurity standards of markets. Reusable, self-disin-\nﬁ fectable and personalized lter-mask, eye protection,\ngloves and gowns should be developed as essential\ncomponents of an environmental-friendly epidemic\ncombat kit for everyone in the global village. Much\nmore work by a highly coordinated real-time global\nsurveillance network has to be done to win this war\nagainst COVID-19 and further emerging epidemics.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the originating and submitting\nlaboratories who contributed sequences to Global Initiative\nﬂ on Sharing All In uenza Data (GISAID) (Supplementary\nTable S1).\nDisclosure statement\nﬁ JFWC has received travel grants from P zer Corporation\nHong Kong and Astellas Pharma Hong Kong Corporation\nLimited, and was an invited speaker for Gilead Sciences\n\nHong Kong Limited and Luminex Corporation.
