COVID-19\nhas impacted every aspect of our lives and has required the\nworld to rapidly mobilize to address all aspects of diagnosis\nand treatment of this disease. COVID-19 has brought to\nlight the challenges of managing a completely novel infec-\ntious disease with existing diagnostics and therapeutics that\nwere insufficient to stem the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the\nresources allotted toward research and development and the\nglobal cooperation of governments, scientists, and clini-\ncians to address COVID-19 required a pace of innovation in\nhealthcare that has never before been observed in order to\naddress this new disease. As a result of this effort, innova-\ntions in technology to better understand, detect, and treat\nCOVID-19 continue to be reported every day. Here at SLAS\nTechnology , we felt it was important to highlight these\nadvances in technology that have been made to better\naddress all aspects of COVID-19 detection and treatment.\nWe present here a special issue that reports how technology\nhas been used to address COVID-19.\nThe spread of COVID-19 across the world has shown that\nany hope for effective control of COVID-19 infection in the\ncommunity requires the development of rapid and accurate\nmethods for detecting COVID-19 infections. Applying exist-\ning and emerging viral detection technologies toward better\nCOVID-19 diagnostics has resulted in incredible advances in\npathogen detection innovations. Miniaturization assays that\nallowed for the accurate analysis and detection of SARS-\nCoV-2 viral nucleic acid detection or host antibody response\n1–3 to COVID-19 have proven to be critical. While diagnostics\ninitially required clinical laboratory tests, these technological\nadvances have proven critical for field testing in the commu-\nnity or in less well-equipped remote diagnostic testing sites.\nIn addition to advances in detecting COVID-19 infections,\nleveraging technology to better understand COVID-19 dis-\nease progression and immune response is critical to develop-\ning better therapies to combat this pandemic. As a result, the\nmolecular mechanisms of COVID-19 infection, as well as an\nunderstanding of the critical immune responses and overall\nbiological responses to COVID-19, have been uncovered in\nan amazingly short amount of time. Much of this has been a\nresult of the use of critical technologies such as single-cell\n2 analysis technologies and advances in mass cytometry.\n\nSLAS Technology\n2020, Vol. 25(6) 511­–512\n© Society for Laboratory\nAutomation and Screening 2020\nDOI: 10.1177/2472630320969634 https://doi.org/10.1177/2472630320969634\njournals.sagepub.com/home/jla\n3 , and Xianting Ding\nThe last few years have seen a paradigm shift in the\ndevelopment and application of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThis has been particularly true for life sciences and biomed-\nical applications. In order to better understand and address\nCOVID-19, AI has played a huge role in improving detec-\ntion and therapeutic drug development. Of particular impor-\ntance has been the development of multiple AI-based\napproaches toward improving COVID-19 detection through\n4,5 standard chest x-ray images. Applying AI toward COVID-\n19 diagnostics through existing standard medical imaging\nallows for more rapid diagnosis through telemedicine and\nautomated tools. As AI begins to pervade every aspect of\nmedicine, it is inevitable that advances in AI technology\nwill be important to overcoming this pandemic.\nIt is now clear that COVID-19 is a unique infection that\naffects a wide range of biological systems. One of the most\naffected systems has been pulmonary function. The ability to\ntreat COVID-19 patients has often required the use of venti-\nlators, and the lack of sufficient ventilators has been linked\nto poorer outcomes. The paucity of ventilators available in\ncomparison to COVID-19 infection rates led to a number of\nadvances in ventilator technology to increase their produc-\n6 tion speed and portability while lowering their cost. These\nadvances allow patients additional time to fight off infection\nas well as allow emerging therapies to work. This pandemic\nhas adversely affected the lives of so many people in so\nmany ways. But, it has also shown that when the global com-\nmunity comes together to collectively address a singular\nproblem, amazing innovations in technology can happen\nthat provide hope for a better future after the pandemic.\nReferences\n1.\t Zhu, N.; Wong, P.
