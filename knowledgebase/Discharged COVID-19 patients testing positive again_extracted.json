ET AL\nFor COVID 19 patients to be discharged from hospitals, they ‐\nmust meet strict criteria. For example, the guidelines of the National\nHealth Commission of China state that patients must meet the fol-\nlowing four benchmarks before they can be discharged: (a) be afeb-\nrile for at least 3 consecutive days, (b) have significantly improved\nrespiratory function, (c) produce two negative SARS CoV 2 RT PCR ‐ ‐ ‐\ntest results at least 24 hours apart, and (d) have significant im-\nprovement in lung GGO lesions determined by chest CT or X ray ‐\n11 Note that the above discharge standards do not require imaging.\npatients to have complete resolution of lung GGO lesions, rather\nsignificant improvement in lung GGO lesions is acceptable when the\nother criteria are met. In China, it is also required that discharged\npatients be quarantined for at least 14 days at specific postdischarge\nquarantine facilities or at home and are monitored for further im-\n11 provement or any signs of relapse.\nGiven these strict discharge criteria, it was surprising to hear the\nannouncement on 25 February 2020 that an estimated 14% of the\ndischarged COVID 19 patients in China's Guangdong Province tested ‐\npositive again for SARS CoV 2 RNA during their postdischarge ‐ ‐\nfollow up examinations. Interestingly, these patients were said to ‐\nhttp://gdio.southcn.com/g/m/2020- have no COVID 19 symptoms ( ‐\n). Similarly, the Korean Center for 02/25/content_190429333.htm\nDisease Control and Prevention announced that as of 15 May 2020\nthere had been 449 individuals who tested positive again after they\nhad been discharged from isolation. Of the 284 individuals for whom\nsymptoms were investigated, 126 (44.7%) showed mild symptoms,\nhttps://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board. such as cough and sore throat (\n). However, when some of these es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030\npatients were tested for the presence of SARS CoV 2 virus, the re- ‐ ‐\nsults were negative. Because of these announcements, several\nquestions emerge why are there some discharged COVID 19 pa- — ‐\ntients that test positive again for SARS CoV 2 RNA? Are they dis- ‐ ‐\ncharged from hospitals too early; are they contagious; do they pose a\nrisk to others? Such questions may fuel public fear and uneasiness\nand call for a careful assessment of public health policies/guidelines\nregarding the discharge of COVID 19 patients. To learn more about ‐\nsuch patients, we conducted a review of identified published reports\non the topic of patients who manifest postdischarge RT PCR posi- ‐\ntivity for SARS CoV 2 RNA. ‐ ‐\nMATERIALS AND METHODS | 2\nWe conducted searches in the PubMed database for reports that\ndescribe discharged COVID 19 patients testing positive again for ‐\nSARS CoV 2. The following combinations of search keywords were ‐ ‐\nused: recovered patients AND COVID 19; SARS CoV 2 AND positive ‐ ‐ ‐\nagain; SARS CoV 2 AND COVID 19 AND recovered; recovered AND ‐ ‐ ‐\nCOVID 19 AND positive again; discharged AND COVID 19 AND ‐ ‐\npositive again; discharged AND COVID 19 AND positive; COVID 19 ‐ ‐\nAND recovered AND positive; COVID 19 AND recovered AND ‐\npositive RT PCR.

Thus, our review focused on ‐\nthese 12 reports. During the search process, information was ex-\ntracted by a single reviewer and then confirmed by others.\nRESULTS | 3\nThe 12 reports we reviewed describe a total of 90 individuals who\n12 24 ‐ It tested positive again in postdischarge follow up examinations. ‐\nshould be emphasized that all of these patients had confirmed SARS ‐\nCoV 2 infection by RT PCR testing, and most of them had GGO le- ‐ ‐\nsions in the lungs and had symptoms such as fever and cough on\nadmission.

It is possible that this results from the\nstrict and vigilant postdischarge monitoring policies in place in Chi-\n11 Although the phenomenon of discharged patients testing po- na.\nsitive again for SARS CoV 2 RNA was officially documented in Korea, ‐ ‐\nour review is limited to published reports from China.\nThere are several possible explanations for what is happening.\nFirst, some of the results could be false positives. However, a sig- “ ”\nnificant number of patients tested positive on different days, and in one\nreport, the positive RT PCR test results were confirmed for all patients ‐\n15 Thus, it is unlikely with testing kits from a different manufacturer.\nthat all results reported were false positives. Second, there remains the\npossibility that residual virus became active again after the patients had\nbeen discharged.

Moreover, they were able to isolate infectious SARS ‐\nCoV 2 virus from two of them, which lead them to suggest that ‐\ninfectious virus in feces is a common manifestation of COVID 19, “ ‐ ”\nand that its presence may be a common feature of COVID 19 and a ‐\npossible mechanism of fecal oral transmission or fecal respiratory ‐ ‐\n6 31 Strikingly, Xiao et al also found the presence of a transmission.\nhigh level of immunoglobulin G antibodies against spike proteins of\nthe SARS CoV 2 virus and the presence of SARS CoV 2 neutralizing ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐\nantibodies in one patient who tested positive for the presence of\ninfectious SARS CoV 2 virus in the stool. This suggests that precau- ‐ ‐\ntions should be taken to avoid potential fecal transmission and un-\nderscores the importance of testing fecal samples from COVID 19 ‐\npatients before and after they are discharged from hospitals. One\nadditional point it should be noted that the RT PCR tests in place — ‐\nonly detect the presence or absence of SARS CoV 2 RNA, not whe- ‐ ‐\nther there is the presence of virus.

For example, the guidelines of the National\nHealth Commission of China state that patients must meet the fol-\nlowing four benchmarks before they can be discharged: (a) be afeb-\nrile for at least 3 consecutive days, (b) have significantly improved\nrespiratory function, (c) produce two negative SARS CoV 2 RT PCR ‐ ‐ ‐\ntest results at least 24 hours apart, and (d) have significant im-\nprovement in lung GGO lesions determined by chest CT or X ray ‐\n11 Note that the above discharge standards do not require imaging.\npatients to have complete resolution of lung GGO lesions, rather\nsignificant improvement in lung GGO lesions is acceptable when the\nother criteria are met. In China, it is also required that discharged\npatients be quarantined for at least 14 days at specific postdischarge\nquarantine facilities or at home and are monitored for further im-\n11 provement or any signs of relapse.\nGiven these strict discharge criteria, it was surprising to hear the\nannouncement on 25 February 2020 that an estimated 14% of the\ndischarged COVID 19 patients in China's Guangdong Province tested ‐\npositive again for SARS CoV 2 RNA during their postdischarge ‐ ‐\nfollow up examinations. Interestingly, these patients were said to ‐\nhttp://gdio.southcn.com/g/m/2020- have no COVID 19 symptoms ( ‐\n). Similarly, the Korean Center for 02/25/content_190429333.htm\nDisease Control and Prevention announced that as of 15 May 2020\nthere had been 449 individuals who tested positive again after they\nhad been discharged from isolation. Of the 284 individuals for whom\nsymptoms were investigated, 126 (44.7%) showed mild symptoms,\nhttps://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board. such as cough and sore throat (\n). However, when some of these es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030\npatients were tested for the presence of SARS CoV 2 virus, the re- ‐ ‐\nsults were negative. Because of these announcements, several\nquestions emerge why are there some discharged COVID 19 pa- — ‐\ntients that test positive again for SARS CoV 2 RNA? Are they dis- ‐ ‐\ncharged from hospitals too early; are they contagious; do they pose a\nrisk to others? Such questions may fuel public fear and uneasiness\nand call for a careful assessment of public health policies/guidelines\nregarding the discharge of COVID 19 patients. To learn more about ‐\nsuch patients, we conducted a review of identified published reports\non the topic of patients who manifest postdischarge RT PCR posi- ‐\ntivity for SARS CoV 2 RNA. ‐ ‐\nMATERIALS AND METHODS | 2\nWe conducted searches in the PubMed database for reports that\ndescribe discharged COVID 19 patients testing positive again for ‐\nSARS CoV 2. The following combinations of search keywords were ‐ ‐\nused: recovered patients AND COVID 19; SARS CoV 2 AND positive ‐ ‐ ‐\nagain; SARS CoV 2 AND COVID 19 AND recovered; recovered AND ‐ ‐ ‐\nCOVID 19 AND positive again; discharged AND COVID 19 AND ‐ ‐\npositive again; discharged AND COVID 19 AND positive; COVID 19 ‐ ‐\nAND recovered AND positive; COVID 19 AND recovered AND ‐\npositive RT PCR. As of 27 April 2020, we identified 15 reports, all of ‐\nwhich described patients in China. Of the 15 reports, 12 specifically\n\n| 263\ndescribed postdischarge RT PCR positivity for SARS CoV 2 RNA in ‐ ‐ ‐\nsurveillance follow up examinations. Thus, our review focused on ‐\nthese 12 reports. During the search process, information was ex-\ntracted by a single reviewer and then confirmed by others.\nRESULTS | 3\nThe 12 reports we reviewed describe a total of 90 individuals who\n12 24 ‐ It tested positive again in postdischarge follow up examinations. ‐\nshould be emphasized that all of these patients had confirmed SARS ‐\nCoV 2 infection by RT PCR testing, and most of them had GGO le- ‐ ‐\nsions in the lungs and had symptoms such as fever and cough on\nadmission. Furthermore, before being discharged from hospitals, all\nof them met the four strict discharge criteria, including having at\n11 least two negative SARS CoV 2 RT PCR test results 24 hours apart. ‐ ‐ ‐\nTherefore, the postdischarge RT PCR positivity was seen against the ‐\nbackdrop of these two negative RT PCR results.

These patients are in all age ‐\ngroups and are of both genders most of them presented mild to —\nmoderate symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, and received\ntreatments with several antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir, ritonavir,\n12 24 ‐ 1 ). Most of lopinavir, interferon, and arbidol in hospitals (Table\nthe individuals did not have symptoms or worsening of chest CT\n12 24 ‐ 1 ).

Nevertheless, we note that in most studies they\nhad tested throat swabs only a few tested other samples, such as —\nfeces, nasopharyngeal swabs, and/or anal swabs for patients before —\nthey were discharged.

However, a sig- “ ”\nnificant number of patients tested positive on different days, and in one\nreport, the positive RT PCR test results were confirmed for all patients ‐\n15 Thus, it is unlikely with testing kits from a different manufacturer.\nthat all results reported were false positives.

Moreover, they were able to isolate infectious SARS ‐\nCoV 2 virus from two of them, which lead them to suggest that ‐\ninfectious virus in feces is a common manifestation of COVID 19, “ ‐ ”\nand that its presence may be a common feature of COVID 19 and a ‐\npossible mechanism of fecal oral transmission or fecal respiratory ‐ ‐\n6 31 Strikingly, Xiao et al also found the presence of a transmission.\nhigh level of immunoglobulin G antibodies against spike proteins of\nthe SARS CoV 2 virus and the presence of SARS CoV 2 neutralizing ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐\nantibodies in one patient who tested positive for the presence of\ninfectious SARS CoV 2 virus in the stool. This suggests that precau- ‐ ‐\ntions should be taken to avoid potential fecal transmission and un-\nderscores the importance of testing fecal samples from COVID 19 ‐\npatients before and after they are discharged from hospitals. One\nadditional point it should be noted that the RT PCR tests in place — ‐\nonly detect the presence or absence of SARS CoV 2 RNA, not whe- ‐ ‐\nther there is the presence of virus. The RNA could be from living, or\ndead, or antibody neutralized virus.
