These treatments may treat mild symptoms and decrease the risk of\nlife-threatening disease. Although these options have been fairly beneficial, there are some challenges and limitations, such\nas cost of tests/drugs, specificity, large treatment dosages, intravenous administration, need for trained personal, lengthy\n19 diagnostic and therapeutic options are vital. Nanobodies (Nbs) are novel monomeric antigen-binding fragments derived\nfrom camelid antibodies. Advantages of Nbs include low immunogenicity, high specificity, stability and affinity. These\ncharacteristics allow for rapid Nb generation, inexpensive large-scale production, effective storage, and transportation, which\nis essential during pandemics. Additionally, the potential aerosolization and inhalation delivery of Nbs allows for targeted\ntreatment delivery as well as patient self-administration. Therefore, Nbs are a viable option to target SARS-CoV-2 and\novercome COVID-19. In this review we discuss (1) COVID-19; (2) SARS-CoV-2; (3) the present conventional COVID-19\ndiagnostics and therapeutics, including their challenges and limitations; (4) advantages of Nbs; and (5) the numerous Nbs\n1  \u0007Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID‑19)\nCoronaviruses are a part of the Coronaviridae family, and the\nfirst human coronaviruses (HCoV) were identified around\nthe 1960s [ 1 ]. Coronavirus infections can be endemic\n(HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63 and -HKU1), which causes the\ncommon cold/mild illness, as well as epidemic (severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], SARS-\nCoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n[MERS-CoV]), which may cause lethal respiratory infec-\ntions [ 1 ]. These viruses emerge periodically and are associ-\nated with major outbreaks [ 2 ]. In November 2002, SARS-\nCoV-1 appeared and caused worldwide infection, with a\n10% lethal rate [ 2 , 3 ]. Thereafter, in June 2012, MERS-CoV\nemerged and showed a 35% lethal rate [ 2 , 3 ].\nMore recently, in December 2019, severe acute res-\npiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged\nin Wuhan, China [ 1 , 3 ]. This highly contagious virus has\nswiftly spread throughout the globe, leading to coronavirus\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n194\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) [ 4 , 5 ] being declared a pandemic\nin March 2020 [ 3 ]. There have been more than 585 mil-\nlion COVID-19 cases and more than 6 million fatalities [ 6 ]\nworldwide [ 4 , 5 ]. Virus transmission may occur through\ndirect contact with infected individuals and exposure to\nSARS-CoV-2-contaminated liquid droplets, surfaces and\nmaterials [ 3 ]. Infected individuals may be asymptomatic\n(absence of all symptoms) or symptomatic (presence of\nsymptoms) [ 7 ]. The common symptoms are fever (87%),\ncough (67%), shortness of breath, loss of taste, and fatigue\n(38%) [ 1 , 3 ]. However, COVID-19 may worsen, resulting in\npneumonia, multi-organ failure, and loss of life [ 1 , 3 ].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many challenges\nto the human population, healthcare systems, and economic\nand social activities [ 8 ]. Notably, the global economic cost\nof the pandemic is over $10.3 trillion [ 9 ]. Initially, the world\nrelied heavily on the implementation of protective/preventa-\ntive measures as it is imperative to control virus transmission\nroutes and infection sources [ 3 ]. These measures included\ndecreased mass gatherings, use of protective gear (masks),\neffective sanitization, maintenance of personal hygiene,\nsocial distancing (2 meters), and a healthy diet/lifestyle (suf-\nficient nutrition and vitamins) [ 3 ].\nPopulation protective immunity or herd immunity refers\nto a high percentage of a population that is immune to a\nparticular disease [ 7 ] with immunity being attained through\ninfection or vaccination [ 7 ]. For COVID-19, approximately\n67% of a population should be immunized to achieve herd\nimmunity, which can potentially decrease the spread of\ndisease [ 7 ]. Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been\ndeveloped, tested and administered in an attempt to reach\npopulation immunity, however the efficacy of vaccines are\nnegatively affected by the emergence of various strains [ 7 ].\nCurrently, several COVID-19 treatment options are avail-\nable [ 1 , 3 ]. Drug repurposing and in vitro inhibition have\ndetermined drugs that can be used [ 1 ], and some drugs/\nGeneral structure of Fig. 1\nSARS-CoV-2 and function\nof structural proteins. SARS-\nCoV-2 severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus-2\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nantibodies (Abs) have been approved by the US FDA for\nCOVID-19 emergency treatment [ 1 ]. However there are\nlimitations and challenges with conventional COVID-19\ndiagnosis and treatment options. Therefore, great strides\ncontinue to be made in the development of effective pre-\nventative, diagnostic and therapeutic agents to combat\nCOVID-19.\n2  \u0007Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\nCoronavirus‑2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)\nThe SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises of open reading frames\n′ (ORFs) that encode various proteins [ 3 ]. At the 5 -terminal\nregion, non-structural proteins (NSPs) essential for virus\nreplication are encoded by ORF1 and ORF2, whereas the\n′ 3 -terminal region encodes functional structural proteins\n(spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], nucleocapsid [N]\nand 8 accessory proteins) [ 3 ]. The M, E and S proteins are\nlocated in the viral envelope, whereas the N protein is found\nin the core of the virus (Fig. 1 ) [ 2 ]. These proteins have spe-\ncific and vital roles that allow the virus to survive and thrive\nin host cells (Fig. 1 ) [ 2 ].\nThe ectoenzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n(ACE2) is situated on the cell plasma membrane in vari-\nous organ tissues but is widely distributed on epithelial\ncells of the respiratory tract [ 2 , 3 ]. The ACE2 receptor is\nutilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells [ 3 ]. The S\nprotein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and\nbinds with high affinity to the ACE2 receptor by forming a\ntransmembrane homotrimer [ 3 ]. It has two subunits, S1 and\nS2, that function in ACE2 binding and viral fusion to cell\nmembranes, respectively [ 3 ]. Additionally, S protein prim-\ning is required for entry into cells [ 10 ]. Cellular proteases\n(TMPRSS2 or cathepsin) prime the S protein by cleavage,\nwhich leads to viral and cellular membrane fusion [ 10 ]. The\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\nRBD can be in an up-state (accessible/active) or down-state\n[ 11 ] (inaccessible/ inactive). The accessible conformation\nhas at least one RBD in an up-state, whereas the inaccessible\nconformation has all the RBDs in a down-state. The S pro-\ntein oscillates between the active and inactive conformation\n[ 11 ]. Notably, the RBD in the accessible up-state is needed\nfor ACE2 to bind and allow cleavage by cellular proteases,\nresulting in a conformational change in S2 which allows\nviral entry [ 11 ]. Therefore, neutralizing agents may bind to\nthe RBD-up conformation, thus inhibiting infection, or bind\nto the RBD-down conformation, which ultimately prevents\nviral entry [ 12 ].\nAfter viral entry, SARS-CoV-2 proceeds to release its\ngenetic material, which is translated into viral replicase\npolyproteins (pp) [ 2 , 3 ]. These proteins are cleaved by viral\nproteinases, leading to the formation of functional NSPs\n(helicase [Hel] and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n[RdRp]) that are responsible for structural protein RNA rep-\nlication [ 3 ]. Notably, the S protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are\npromising drug targets [ 10 ].\nThe emergence of variants (Table 1 ) such as Alpha\n(B.1.1.7, UK), Beta (B.1.351, South Africa [SA]), Gamma\n(P.1, Brazil), Delta (B.1.617.2, India) and Omicron\n(B.1.1.529, Botswana/SA) [ 13 ] are of great concern [ 14 ,\n15 ]. Each of these variants lead to a new wave of infections\nand can potentially evade host immunity (developed post\ninfection or vaccination) as well as therapeutics [ 14 , 15 ].\nNotably, the Omicron variant has been shown to be more\ntransmissible, have an increased rate of infections, higher\nre-infection risk profile, greater immune escape capabilities\nand the largest number of mutations compared with the other\nSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and their mutations [ 4 , 6 , 18 , Table 1\nEmergence country and date SARS-CoV-2 variant Mutations\nUK B.1.1.7/Alpha\nSeptember 2020\nSouth Africa B.1.351/Beta\nMay 2020\nBrazil P.1/Gamma\nNovember 2020\nP314L, E1264D, S253P, E92\nIndia B.1.617.2/Delta\nOctober 2020\nSouth Africa B.1.1.529/Omicron\nNovember 2021\nN28del, A29del\nSARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2\n\n195\nvariants (Table 1 ) [ 6 , 13 , 15 ]. Notably, individuals infected\nwith the Delta and Beta variant have a 40% and 60% chance\nof re-infection with the Omicron variant, respectively [ 13 ].\nMutations in the S protein, such as E484K and N501Y, have\nbeen identified in the Brazil, SA, and UK variants (Table 1 )\n[ 16 ]. Mutations such as D614G, N501Y, and K417N allow\nthe virus to be more infectious, while the H655Y, N679K,\nand P681H mutations allow the virus to be more transmissi-\nble [ 6 ]. These mutations alter RBD epitopes, allow the virus\nto escape Ab neutralization, evade host immune responses,\nmay render treatments ineffective [ 4 ], and enhance receptor\nbinding specificity, virus growth [ 16 ], infectivity and viru-\nlence [ 17 ].\nNotably, SARS-CoV-2 strains have been associated with\ndevastating outbreaks, greatly increased infection rates and\ndecreased vaccine efficacy [ 4 ]. Additionally, the continuous\nemergence of new variants has the potential to cause waves\nof infection in populations that already achieved protective\nimmunity against previous strains [ 4 ]. Taken together, vari-\nants and associated mutations may negatively impact Ab\nand vaccine efficacy, which increases the number of Abs\nand vaccines required for protective and therapeutic pur-\nposes [ 16 ].\n3  \u0007Current Diagnosis Methods for COVID‑19\nAfter the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, diagnostic tests were rap-\nidly developed in order to detect the virus earlier rather than\nlater [ 3 ]. Specimen collection by nasopharyngeal swabs are\npreferred and accepted for molecular analysis/detection [ 3 ,\n19 ]\nH69del, V70del, Y144del, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H,\nD3L, R203K, G204R, S235F, T1001I, A1708D, I2230T, S3675del, G3676del,\nF3677del, P314L, Q27*, R52I, Y73C\nD80A, D215G, L241del, L242del, A243del, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V,\nT205I, P71L, T265I, K1655N, K3353R, S3675del, G3676del, F3677del, P314L, Q57H\nL18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I,\nV1176F, P80R, R203K, G204R, S1188L, K1795Q, S3675del, G3676del, F3677del,\nT19R, E156del, F157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N, D63G,\nR203M, D377Y, I82T, P314L, G662S, P1000L, S26L, ORF7a V82A, T120I, ORF8\nQ27*, R52I, Y73C, E92K D119del, F120del, ORF9b T60A\nA67V, H69del, V70del, T95I, G142del, V143del, Y144del, Y145D, N211del, L212I,\nG339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A,\nQ493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H,\nN764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K, L981F, P13L, E31del, R32del, S33del,\nR203K, G204R, T9I, D3G, Q19E, A63T, K856R, S2083del, L2084I, A2710T, T3255I,\nP3395H, L3674del, S3675del, G3676del, I3758V, P314L, I1566V, P10S, E27del,\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n196\n20 ]. However, in the absence of nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal\nsecretions, blood, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage sam-\nples are collected [ 3 , 21 ]. Notably, viral RNA load, which\ncan affect detection methods, is usually highest between 0\nand 4 days (89%) and then decreases between 10 and 14 days\n(54%) [ 20 ]. Unfortunately, sample collection can be uncom-\nfortable for the patient and sample processing is a lengthy\nprocedure requiring a laboratory facility. Additionally, both\nsample collection and processing require trained personal.\nSpecimens are evaluated using virus-specific serological and\nmolecular tests in order to provide a diagnosis [ 21 ]. Specific\nSARS-CoV-2 proteins are identified using enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen tests, point-of-care\n(POC) blood test or Western blots (serological tests), while\nspecific SARS-CoV-2 genes are detected using quantitative\npolymerase chain reaction (qPCR), real-time PCR (RT-PCR)\nor northern blot hybridization (molecular tests) [ 7 , 20 – 22 ].\nInitially, positive cases were identified using RT-PCR; there-\nafter, ELISA kits and various other tests were developed [ 3 ].\nThe RT-PCR technique is an accurate assay regularly\nutilized for SARS-CoV-2 detection and diagnosis [ 8 , 22 ].\nCurrently, there are various COVID-19 RT-PCR kits com-\nmercially available that target various viral genes (RdRp, E,\nN, S, ORF1ab, ORF1a, and ORF1b or ORF8) for detection\n[ 8 , 20 , 23 ]. Notably, RT-PCR has been considered the gold\nstandard but there are advantages and challenges. RT-qPCR\nprovides reliability, flexibility, high sensitivity and specific-\nity, however the challenges include false negatives, a lengthy\nand complex procedure, requirement of expensive equipment\nand trained personnel, sample quantities for RNA isolation,\nsample integrity, low viral load samples, and delivery time\nof results to patients (> 24 h) [ 23 , 24 ]. Additionally, muta-\ntions in the target regions have the potential to effect RT-\nPCR accuracy, resulting in test failures and false-negatives\n[ 20 ]. However, researchers are developing specific primers\nto allow the detection of major variants [ 20 ].\nThe Omicron variant can affect RT-PCR test perfor-\nmance, e.g. the Thermo Fischer TaqPath assay attributable to\nthe 69–70 deletion [ 25 ], which can lead to the failure of cer-\ntain PCR assays [ 13 ]. This indicates the importance of tests\ntargeting more than one genomic region of SARS-CoV-2,\nas this may prevent test failures and false negative results\n[ 25 ]. Notably, PCR diagnostics can determine the SARS-\nCoV-2 cases that need sequencing to detect Omicron cases\n[ 13 ]. In the Alpha variant S gene, amino acids 69 and 70 are\ndeleted (Δ69–70), resulting in the absent/negative S-gene\n(S−), whereas the Delta variant does not contain the 69–70\ndeletion, resulting in a positive S-gene (S+) [ 13 ]. The Omi-\ncron variant S-gene also contains the 69–70 deletion [ 13 ].\nSince the Alpha variant cases have decreased considerably,\nthe S− results (suspect Omicron infection) could be used as\na marker, together with sequencing, for Omicron detection\n[ 13 , 25 ]. However, variants do have sub-lineages and the\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nOmicron BA.2 sub-lineage does not contain the 69–70 dele-\ntion, hence it is S+ [ 6 ]. Therefore, whole-genome sequenc-\ning with next-generation sequencing is required for confir-\nmation of the Omicron variant even though it is a lengthy\nand expensive process [ 6 , 26 ].\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has\nbeen considered a reliable alternative to conventional RT-\nPCR [ 20 ]. It is a fast and cheap method that is highly specific\ndue to the use of 6–8 specific primer sequences that detect\neight different regions [ 20 ]. Additionally, it can identify\nSARS-CoV-2 from swabs or saliva without the requirement\nof RNA isolation [ 23 ]. The RT-LAMP method is inexpen-\nsive, fast, and highly specific, however sensitivity is depend-\nent on viral load [ 24 ]. Notably, proper primer design and use\nof specific primers are essential to maximize sensitivity [ 23 ].\nThe ELISA method is a cost-effective quantitative, quali-\ntative, highly specific, sensitive, efficient and simple pro-\ncedure [ 23 ]. ELISAs are reliable, commercially available\nkits that mostly detect the S and N proteins [ 20 ]. However,\nthe ELISA success rate is greatly dependent on the stage of\nCOVID-19 and the viral load [ 20 ]. Additionally, ELISAs\ncan detect Abs produced against a specific viral antigen (S\nand N proteins) [ 20 ]. Several kits measure the ratio between\nimmunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG [ 20 ]. ELISA sensitivity\nand specificity were shown to be 85.7–80% and 98.5–100%,\nrespectively [ 24 ]. ELISAs are able to detect recent or pre-\nvious SARS-CoV-2 exposure, however challenges include\nsample quantity, sample integrity and lengthy assay proce-\ndure, and results are dependent on a patient’s immunity (IgG\nand IgM) and delivery time of the results (> 24 h) [ 24 ].\nLateral flow assays (LFAs) identify SARS-CoV-2 anti-\ngens (N) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs (IgG and IgM) [ 24 ]. It\nis a simple, qualitative test that does not require specialized/\nexpensive laboratory equipment [ 24 ]. LFAs are used as POC\ntesting and are small in size, fast, sensitive (90%), specific\n(98%), stable, and low in cost [ 23 ]. However, LFAs can pro-\nduce false-negative results due to low viral load samples\n[ 24 ]. Mistry et al. reviewed the literature on LFAs in order\nto assess sensitivity and specificity [ 27 ]. The percentage sen-\nsitivity of assays showed a wide range of 37–99%, whereas\nspecificity was 92–100% [ 27 ]. The CORIS and BIOSEN-\nSOR assays were the lowest in sensitivity (45%), whereas\nthe most evaluated Panbio Abbott assay had a sensitivity\nof 78.41% [ 27 ]. The specificity of all assays was > 93%\n[ 27 ]. Notably, the BD Veritor, BIOCREDIT, COVID-VIRO\nassays showed 100% specificity [ 27 ].\nAntigen-detecting diagnostic tests allow for rapid and\ninexpensive delivery of results [ 28 ]. Commercially avail-\nable tests include the Panbio (Abbott), Standard Q (SD\nBiosensor/Roche), Sure Status (Premier Medical Corpora-\ntion), 2019-nCoV (Wondfo), Beijng Tigsun Diagnostics Co.\nLtd. (Tigsun), Onsite (CTK Biotech), Acon Biotech (Flow-\nflex), and the NowCheck Covid-19 Ag test (Bionote) [ 28 ].\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\nNotably, five of these tests (Panbio, SD Biosensor, Sure Sta-\ntus, Onsite, and Acon) are on the World Health Organization\n(WHO) emergency use listing [ 28 ]. Bekliz et al. investigated\nthe sensitivity of these eight tests against the variants [ 28 ].\nCompared with other variants, these tests showed a general\nlower sensitivity to Omicron BA.1 in cultured virus and in\ninfectious virus analysis [ 28 ]. Notably, the Acon test dem-\nonstrated the most sensitivity for Omicron-BA.1 and most\nother variants [ 28 ].\nHardick et al. compared the sensitivity of POC antigen\nassays (BD Veritor, Abbott BinaxNow, Orasure InteliSwab\nand Quidel QuickVue) in detecting the Omicron and Delta\nvariants [ 29 ]. Results showed that the assays with the highest\nsensitivity for the Omicron variant were Abbott BinaxNow\nand Orasure InteliSwab, whereas those with the highest\nsensitivity for the Delta variant were Orasure InteliSwab\nand Quidel QuickVue [ 29 ]. Notably, only the QuickVue\nassay detected all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive nasal/\nnasopharyngeal swab samples [ 29 ]. The Omicron variant\nwas identified by these rapid antigen tests, however there is\nstill a decreased sensitivity of antigen tests compared with\nmolecular tests [ 29 ]. At high virus levels, the BinaxNOW\ntest (Abbott) was shown to identify infections with vari-\nants, including the Omicron variant [ 30 ]. However, at low\nvirus levels (early stage of infection), the BinaxNOW test\nmay indicate a negative result, thus a confirmatory RT-PCR\nshould be conducted [ 30 ].\nAntigen detection tests that target the N antigen can pre-\nvent test invalidation due to changes in the S protein [ 25 ].\nHowever, the Omicron variant has some mutations in its\nN sequence which may negatively impact the N antigen\ndetection tests [ 25 ]. In comparison with PCR tests, some\nstudies have indicated that about half of the positive cases\nidentified by rapid tests are false positives [ 6 ]. Generally,\nantigen tests have been less sensitive than RT-PCR tests,\ntherefore negative antigen test results should be verified by\nan RT-PCR test, especially for a possible Omicron infection\n[ 6 , 25 ]. There are also mutation-specific tests (E484K/Q,\nL452R, N501Y) that identify mutations that can be linked\nto the variants [ 25 ].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\n(CRISPR) have the potential to provide rapid, accurate and\nportable diagnostic assays [ 20 , 31 ]. The principle of the\ntechnology is that CRISPR RNA (crRNA) can bind to spe-\ncific target sequences and activate CRISPR and CRISPR-\nassociated (Cas) enzymes such as Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13\n[ 23 , 31 ]. This has been referred to as next-generation diag-\nnostics, and CRISPR-Cas technology has been utilized in\nthe development of tools to identify SARS-CoV-2 infec-\ntion [ 31 ]. Liang et al. (2021) developed and validated a\nCRISPR-Cas12a-based multiplex allele-specific assay for\nSARS-CoV-2 variant identification that is highly sensi-\ntive and specific [ 31 ]. The assay is capable of identifying\n\n197\nsingle nucleotide mutations and recognizing variants (Alpha,\nBeta and Delta) based on a combination of various crRNAs\nthat are specific for vital SARS-CoV-2 mutations (K417N,\nL452R/Q, T478K, E484K/Q, and N501Y) [ 31 ]. Notably, it\nrequires a comprehensive interpretation of multiple results\ndue to no single mutation, or one crRNA could distinguish\nbetween all variants [ 31 ]. Thereafter, Liang et al. investi-\ngated the use of the CRISPR-Cas12a assay for detection of\nthe omicron variant [ 32 ], and the results indicated that one\ncrRNA containing 3–4 mutations was able to identify and\ndiagnose the variant [ 32 ]. Finally, the CRISPR-Cas12a assay\nwas shown to detect major variants of concern (Alpha, Beta,\nDelta, and Omicron) in clinical samples [ 33 ]. Wang et al.\ndescribed the detection method, light-up CRISPR-Cas13\ntranscription amplification, which can target and identify\nSARS-CoV-2 as well as mutated variants [ 34 ]. The ligation\nprocess and Cas13a/crRNA recognition ensures sequence\nspecificity (detects mutations), while the light-up RNA\naptamer leads to the sensitive output of signals [ 34 ]. This\nassay may be useful in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in swabs and\nfood packages [ 34 ]. The CRISPR method is fast and simple\nand expensive equipment is not needed, however virus muta-\ntions can cause false results [ 24 ].\nDiagnostic and treatment interventions should target con-\nserved areas due to the development of mutations in cer-\ntain areas [ 26 ]. Therefore, the current research is focused\non developing SARS-CoV-2 detection assays that are cost\neffective, have easy sample collection (e.g. saliva or finger\nprick), are user friendly (conducted by the patient), and have\nrapid indication of results (15–30 min).\n4  \u0007Current Treatments for COVID‑19\nThe pandemic lead to an urgent need for treatments to com-\nbat the disease and save lives. Treatments that disrupt the\nlifecycle may decrease viral replication and spread, whereas\ntreatments that target host receptor proteins can decease/\nblock virus attachment and entry [ 35 ]. Various treatment\noptions have been proposed for SARS-CoV-2, such as repur-\nposing of antiviral treatments, passive immunotherapy, vac-\ncines and Abs. Although these options have been beneficial\nto a certain extent, there have been various limitations and\nchallenges observed with their use.\n4.1  \u0007Antiviral Treatments\nRepurposed antiviral treatments have been investigated for\ntheir possible use and are under investigation in randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) [ 3 ]. The drugs included lopinavir\n(LPV), ribavirin, favipiravir (FPV), remdesivir, chloroquine,\nmolnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, and paxlovid.\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n198\nPreviously, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that\nLPV (antiretroviral protease inhibitor) [ 36 ] impeded coro-\nnavirus protease activity [ 3 ]. Furthermore, the LPV and\nritonavir (RTV; inhibits LPV metabolism) combination\ntreatment has been used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV\n[ 3 ]. However, in severely SARS-CoV-2 infected individu-\nals, the LPV/RTV treatment demonstrated no benefit [ 3 ,\n37 ]. Şimşek-Yavuz et al. reviewed and analyzed data from\nrandomized clinical trials and concluded LPV/RTV was\nineffective and should not be utilized [ 38 ]. Moreover, a sys-\ntematic review of RCTs reported that in COVID-19 patients,\nLPV/RTV utilization did not provide any significant clinical\nimprovement and adverse reactions were notable [ 39 ].\nThe guanosine nucleoside analog ribavirin depletes\nintracellular guanosine, increases interferon (IFN) gene\nexpression, and targets viral RdRp [ 3 , 36 ]. In a MERS-CoV\nstudy, ribavirin and IFNα-2b treatment was promising [ 36 ].\nHowever in respiratory patients, ribavirin decreases hemo-\nglobin concentrations, which decreases its antiviral poten-\ntial against SARS-CoV-2 [ 36 ]. FPV is also a guanosine\nanalog that targets RdRP [ 36 ]. In COVID-19 patients, FPV\nimproved fever and cough but did not improve the recovery\nrate [ 40 ]. Qomara et al. reviewed RCTs of antiviral drugs\nand the results indicated that the clinical status of patients\nwas improved following FPV treatment, but there was no\nsignificant change in clinical recovery [ 39 ].\nRemdesivir (an adenosine nucleotide analog) has shown\nantiviral activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [ 3 , 36 ].\nIt inhibits RdRp, integrates into viral RNA, and decreases viral\nRNA production [ 20 , 36 ]. Remdesivir has also been shown\nto inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation ( in vitro ) [ 36 , 41 ]. The\nFDA approved remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment in adult,\npediatric and old-age patients [ 6 ]. In a COVID-19 clinical\ntrial, remdesivir treatment demonstrated clinical improvement\n(68%) in individuals [ 42 ], but it should not be used in patients\nreceiving invasive ventilation due to increased mortality rates\nnoted [ 42 ]. A review of RCTs revealed that the potential ben-\nefits of remdesivir treatment in hospitalized patients included\nfaster recovery time, decreased length of hospitalization, and\nrespiratory adverse effects, but its effect on decreasing mortality\nwas unclear [ 39 ].\nChloroquine increases endosomal pH, interferes with M\nprotein proteolytic processing, alters virion assembly, and\ninterferes with ACE2 receptor and S protein glycosylation, ulti-\nmately blocking viral infection [ 3 , 36 ]. It was shown to inhibit\nSARS-CoV-2 in vitro [ 36 ]. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, an\nincrease in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels was noted [ 3 ].\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine derivative)\nhave demonstrated immunomodulatory effects as well as the\ncapability of suppressing IL-6 and IL-10 immune responses\n[ 3 ]. The adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine\ntreatment may be severe, e.g. cardiac arrhythmia [ 43 ]. Notably,\na chloroquine overdose is toxic and fatal [ 36 ]. Initially, clinical\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nstudies demonstrated the potential of chloroquine/hydroxychlo-\nroquine as an effective COVID-19 treatment [ 44 ], and more\nrecently, Axfors et al. estimated the effects of hydroxychloro-\nquine and chloroquine by reviewing and analyzing data from\nRCTs [ 43 ]. Their results concluded that chloroquine treatment\nproduced no benefit, whereas hydroxychloroquine treatment\nwas associated with increased COVID-19 patient mortality\n[ 43 ]. Additionally, Şimşek-Yavuz et al. concluded that hydrox-\nychloroquine was ineffective and should not be utilized [ 38 ].\nMolnupiravir targets viral RNA polymerase and integrates\ninto SARS-CoV-2 genetic information, leading to a change in\nthe virus [ 6 ] and ultimately inhibiting/preventing further repli-\ncation [ 45 ]. The FDA approved molnupiravir for emergency use\nfor COVID-19. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir have been shown\nto inhibit viral polymerase and protease (e.g. 3CL protease) [ 6 ],\nresulting in a decrease in disease progression [ 45 ]. Utilization\nof a molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir combination has a great anti-\nviral effect [ 26 ] and has demonstrated efficacy against Omicron\ninfection [ 26 , 46 ].\nPaxlovid interferes with the SARS-CoV-2 processing pro-\nteins, which prevents transmission [ 26 , 46 ], and has shown\npotential against COVID-19 [ 26 ]. The FDA approved paxlovid\n(nirmatrelvir tablets and RTV tablets) for emergency use in\nCOVID-19 patients experiencing mild to moderate symptoms\nand who were at high risk of developing severe illness [ 6 ].\nNotably, molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, remdesivir, and pax-\nlovid have demonstrated neutralizing activity against vari-\nants, including Omicron [ 6 , 45 ]. Lai et al. reviewed and\nanalyzed data from RCTs to determine the clinical efficacy\nand safety of antiviral drugs for non-hospitalized COVID-\n19 patients [ 47 ]. Their results indicated that antiviral drugs\nwere related to a significantly lower risk of hospitalization/\ndeath [ 47 ]. Additionally, nirmatrelvir plus RTV was the best\nantiviral treatment with the lowest hospitalization/death risk,\nfollowed by remdesivir and molnupiravir [ 47 ].\nAntiviral therapy that rapidly decreases viral load may\nimprove patient outcomes and limit virus transmission [ 26 ].\nAntiviral drugs have been approved and have shown some\npotential against COVID-19, however some may have lower\nSARS-CoV-2 specificity especially due to mutations/vari-\nants [ 48 ]. In COVID-19 patients, antiviral drugs have been\nprescribed and accepted but further research is needed to\ndetermine and understand the potential negative effects [ 26 ].\nThus, the continual development of therapeutics is essential.\n4.2  \u0007Vaccines\nVaccines are a preventative option [ 7 ] and SARS-CoV-2\nvaccine categories include mRNA, adenoviral vector, and\ninactivated and recombinant subunit vaccines [ 49 ]. There are\napproximately 216 COVID-19 vaccines in development and\n92 are in human clinical trials [ 49 ]. The WHO has approved\ncertain vaccines for emergency use, such as the BNT162b2\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\n(Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna Biotech)\nmRNA vaccines, the ChAdOx1 (AZD1222) (AstraZeneca)\nand Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) adenovi-\nral vector vaccines, the Coronavac (Sinovac Life Sciences)\nand COVAXIN (Bharat Biotech) inactivated vaccines, and\nthe Nuvaxovid (Novavax) and Covovax (Serum Institute of\nIndia) recombinant subunit vaccines [ 49 ].\nTo date, a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been\nadministered to the population and have proven to be effective\nto a certain degree [ 13 ]. The rAd26-S and rAd5-S adenovi-\nral vector vaccines are well tolerated, induce strong immune\nresponses, and stimulated similar concentrations of neutraliz-\ning Abs as recovered COVID-19 patients [ 50 ]. Jackson et al.\nrevealed that the mRNA-1273 vaccine stimulated immune\nresponses against SARS-CoV-2 [ 51 ]. Notably, the Pfizer vac-\ncine successfully prevented COVID-19 by approximately 90%\n[ 7 ], and its efficacy against hospitalization was about 93% [ 45 ].\nHowever, there have been recurring SARS-CoV-2 infec-\ntions, which suggests that certain individuals do not develop\na highly protective immune response and do not sufficiently\nrespond to vaccinations [ 4 ]. Additionally, studies have shown\nthat 6 months after vaccination, the level of serum neutralizing\nAbs greatly decreased [ 15 ]. To make matters worse, several\nhighly virulent and transmissible strains have been identified,\nwhich affects the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments\n[ 4 ]. Notably, in individuals who have recovered from a COVID-\n19 infection or received an mRNA vaccine (two doses), the\npoly-mutant S was mostly fully resistant to neutralizing Abs\n[ 13 ].\nPreviously, most vaccines have shown effectiveness against\nthe Alpha variant, however vaccine efficacy was considerably\nreduced against the Beta variant and further reduced against the\nGamma variant [ 49 ]. For example, in individuals who received\nthe CoronaVac vaccine, the neutralizing Abs against the vari-\nants were decreased by 2.9- 12.5-fold (Alpha, 2.9-fold; Beta,\nGamma, Delta, and Omicron, 12.5-fold) [ 52 ]. The BNT162b2\nvaccine-induced Ab titers decreased by 4- to 6-fold for Delta\ncompared with the Alpha variant [ 53 ]. The efficacy of the\nAZD1222 and BNT162b2 complete vaccinations was 67–88 %\nagainst the Delta variant compared with 74–94% for the Alpha\nvariant [ 53 ].\nThe Omicron variant showed a greater resistance against\nvaccine-induced immunity [ 53 ]. In SA, vaccine efficacy\nagainst infection decreased by the Delta and Omicron variants\nby 80% and 33%, respectively [ 13 ]. Furthermore, vaccine-\ninduced (mRNA-1273, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Ad26.COV2.S,\nBNT162b2, AZD1222) neutralizing Ab titers against the Omi-\ncron variant significantly decreased [ 53 ]. For instance, Ab titers\ninduced by BNT162b2 and AZD1222 against Omicron were\n36- to 44-fold lower ( in vitro ) [ 53 ]. In comparison with the\noriginal strain, both the mRNA1273 and AstraZeneca complete\nvaccinations showed a decrease in neutralizing Abs against the\nOmicron variant by 74-fold and 14- to 21-fold, respectively\n\n199\n[ 45 ]. Although, COVID-19 vaccines based on wild-type dem-\nonstrated reduced efficacy against the variants, they are still\neffective against the development of severe disease, hospitaliza-\ntion, and death [ 13 , 15 ]. For example, the efficacy of the Pfizer-\nBioNTech vaccine is decreased by the Omicron variant but still\ndecreases the risk of hospitalization (70%) [ 13 ].\nDue to the continuous emergence of several SARS-CoV-2\nvariants, there is a requirement for booster vaccines or new\nvaccines that are tailored against various strains. Previous stud-\nies have demonstrated that heterologous boosters have greater\nneutralization efficacy against variants than the homologous\nvaccines [ 26 , 49 , 53 ]. Notably, a booster vaccination is able to\nrestore Ab levels, enhance vaccine efficacy and provide pro-\ntection against variants, including Omicron [ 13 , 15 , 54 ]. In\npolyclonal sera from BNT162b2 (two doses) vaccinated and\nrecovered individuals, there was a lack of neutralizing activity\nagainst the Omicron variant as well as resistance to monoclonal\nAbs (mAbs) [ 55 ]. Notably, mRNA booster immunizations led\nto a marked increase in neutralizing activity against the Omi-\ncron variant in these individuals [ 55 ]. An mRNA booster vac-\ncine was shown to induce strong variant cross-neutralization\n[ 45 ]. In comparison with the Wuhan strain, post mRNA vac-\ncine BNT162b2 (two doses) showed a > 22-fold decrease in\nOmicron-neutralizing Ab titers; however, after a booster dose,\nthe levels were increased 23-fold [ 56 ]. In individuals vaccinated\nwith adenovirus or inactivated vaccines, an mRNA vaccine\nbooster can induce elevated levels of neutralizing Abs against\nthe Omicron variant [ 49 ].\nPreviously, a vaccine targeting the mutant S demonstrated\nthat the level of neutralizing Abs against mutant viruses\nwas high, but Ab levels against wild-type were lower [ 15 ,\n57 ]. Although booster vaccines increase neutralizing activ-\nity against the Omicron variant, the neutralizing activity is\nstill lower than the neutralizing activity against the original\nstrain [ 45 ]. Polyvalent vaccines elicit Abs against diverse\nepitopes and are therefore able to be effective against several\nvariants [ 26 ]. Taken together, continuous research is vital to\ndevelop bivalent vaccines (targeting wild-type and variants)\nand variant-specific vaccines (against the Omicron variant)\n[ 15 , 57 ].\n4.3  \u0007Passive Immunotherapy and Antibodies\nTherapeutic options for COVID-19 may include passive Ab\ntherapy that can reduce virus replication and disease sever-\nity [ 35 ]. Passive immunotherapy utilizes Abs that recognize\nepitopic regions in a virus [ 35 ]. These Abs can be isolated\nfrom infected individuals and/or scientifically produced in\na laboratory [ 35 ].\nA form of immunotherapy is early convalescent plasma\n(CP) or hyperimmune Ig administration [ 35 ]. Infected indi-\nviduals develop a specific immune response/Abs against\nSARS-CoV-2, therefore the CP can be obtained from\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n200\nrecovered patients who have significant Ab titers [ 7 , 35 ].\nThis therapy may be effective in virus neutralization, preven-\ntion of future infection, reduction in viral load, and mortal-\nity [ 7 , 35 ]. The FDA authorized high-titer CP treatment for\nemergency use in hospitalized patients with compromised\nhumoral immunity and/or early-stage disease [ 9 ]. Data from\n16 RCTs indicated that in non-severe patients, CP has no\nbenefit [ 58 ]; therefore, WHO recommended against CP uti-\nlizations in non-severe patients, but it can be used for critical\npatients within clinical trials [ 58 ].\nSeveral Abs (e.g. B38, H4, CB6 and 4A8) have been iso-\nlated from convalescent COVID-19 individuals. The B38\nand H4 Abs blocked RBD-ACE2 binding and decreased\nvirus titers in infected lungs ( in vivo ) [ 59 ]. The CB6 Ab\ninterferes with the virus-receptor interaction and neutralizes\nSARS-CoV-2 in vitro [ 60 ]. On the other hand, the 4A8 mAb\ndoes not block the S–ACE2 interaction, but showed high\nneutralization potency against the authentic and pseudotyped\nvirus in vitro [ 61 ].\nMemory B-cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 can be iso-\nlated from convalescent COVID-19 individuals and used to\nidentify/clone mAbs [ 62 ]. Cloned mAbs bind specifically\nto RBD, block the RBD–ACE2 interaction, and neutralize\npseudotyped virus infection [ 62 ]. Three RBD-specific mAbs\n(P2C-1F11, P2B-2F6 and P2C-1A3) demonstrated potent\nneutralization of live virus [ 63 ]. Pinto et al. described mAbs,\nsuch as S309, that target SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein [ 64 ].\nThe S309 mAb demonstrated potent authentic and pseu-\ndovirus neutralization [ 64 ]. Notably, the neutralization was\nenhanced by Ab cocktails that contain S309 [ 64 ].\nIn comparison with the original strain, the neutralization\npotency of CP against variants is significantly decreased\n[ 45 ].\nThe Omicron variant successfully escapes Abs that were\ninduced by infection with previous variants, which indicates\nthat CP may not be effective [ 26 ]. Ma et al. revealed that in\ncomparison with the wild-type strain with D614G mutation,\nthe 1-year post-infection CP demonstrated a reduction in\nneutralization activity against the Omicron (10.15-fold) and\nDelta (1.79-fold) variants [ 65 ]. Notably, there was a much\ngreater decrease in neutralization activity against the Omi-\ncron variant [ 65 ] .\nPreviously, Ab phage-display libraries from recovered\nCOVID-19 patients were used to isolate Abs that have\nshown potent neutralization of certain variants (picomo-\nlar doses) [ 66 ]. The NE12 Ab neutralizes the Alpha and\nDelta variants, while the NA8 Ab neutralizes the Beta and\nOmicron variants [ 66 ]. Additionally, in a golden Syrian\nhamster model, the NE12 and NA8 Abs demonstrated pre-\nventative and therapeutic efficacy [ 66 ].\nHowever, there are many challenges with the use of CP\ntreatment that require further evaluation [ 35 ]. Challenges\ninclude insufficient donor availability, health condition\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nof donors, viral kinetics, variability between different\nbatches of plasma, and host interactions of SARS-CoV-2\n[ 35 ]. Notably, the variability between one batch of CP and\nanother batch leads to several levels of success (low–high),\nwhich limits treatment reliability [ 9 ].\nAntibodies such as mAbs, functional antigen-binding\nfragment (Fab), and single-chain variable region fragment\n(scFv) can be used to prevent and treat infections [ 67 ].\nThese scientifically generated Abs can be developed to\ntarget S1-RBD, S1 N-terminal domain (NTD), and the S2\nregion [ 67 ]. Therefore, viral infection can be inhibited by\nAbs blocking RBD-receptor binding as well as impeding\nS2-mediated membrane fusion and viral entry [ 67 ].\nPreviously, Abs have been developed against SARS-\nCoV-1 and MERS-CoV [ 67 ]. In vitro and in vivo , SARS-\nCoV-1 Abs demonstrated strong neutralizing activity, but\nthese Abs have not been evaluated in clinical studies [ 67 ].\nSimilarly, the majority of the MERS-CoV Abs still need\nto be evaluated in clinical studies [ 67 ].\nNotably, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have a ± 79%\nsimilarity and a high S protein sequence identity [ 2 , 67 ].\nTherefore, scientists have investigated the potential cross-\nreactivity and cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-1\nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 35 , 67 ]. Both m396\nand CR3014 are potent SARS-CoV-1-specific Abs that tar-\nget the ACE2 binding site [ 68 ], but these Abs do not bind\nto the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [ 68 ]. On the other hand, the\nSARS-CoV-1 Ab CR3022 does bind to the SARS-CoV-2\nS protein with high affinity [ 68 ].\nWang et al. produced a human 47D11 mAb and showed\nthat it  strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped\nvesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection and neutralizes\nauthentic infection in vitro [ 69 ]. Thereafter, a clinical trial\ndemonstrated that an mAb cocktail significantly decreased\nhospitalization and deaths associated with COVID-19 [ 9 ].\nSubsequently, the FDA authorized three mAb cocktails for\nemergency use in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2\nand at high risk for developing detrimental COVID-19 [ 9 ].\nSeveral mAbs have shown to be effective in the treat-\nment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including bamlanivimab,\nregdanvimab, etesevimab, cilgavimab, tixagevimab,\ncasirivimab, and imdevimab [ 26 ]. Most mAbs target/\ninhibit the S protein RBD [ 6 ], and variants, especially the\nOmicron variant, [ 18 ] have several S protein mutations\n[ 26 ]. These alterations change the binding of Abs to vari-\nants, which may affect their neutralization capabilities and\nallow variants to resist mAb neutralization [ 26 ].\nThe FDA has approved certain mAbs for emergency uti-\nlization to treat COVID-19 patients who may progress to\nsevere disease [ 6 ]. These mAbs include bamlanivimab plus\netesevimab, casirivimab plus imdevimab (REGEN-COV ),\nTM\nsotrovimab, and tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld)\n[ 6 ].\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\nTM REGEN-COV is beneficial for targeting variants and\ndecreasing immune escape [ 20 ]. In a phase III trial, REGEN-\nTM COV treatment led to a 70% decrease in hospitalization/\ndeath of COVID-19 patients [ 20 ]. In adults and pediatric\nTM COVID-19 patients, REGEN-COV is FDA approved for\nthe treatment of mild to moderate disease that has a high risk\nTM of developing into severe disease [ 20 ]. REGEN-COV , and\nbamlanivimab + etesevimab treatments demonstrated effi-\ncacy against previous variants of concern, but decreased or\nno neutralization activity against the Omicron variant [ 45 ].\nPreviously, the bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) and etese-\nvimab (LY-CoV016) Ab cocktail was approved for emer-\ngency use [ 15 ]. Mutations at the S protein positions 484 and\n417 have been related to immune evasion [ 15 ]. The Beta\nand Gamma variants were shown to escape neutralization by\nbamlanivimab due to the E484K mutation and etesevimab\ndue to the K417N/T [ 70 ] mutation. The E484A and K417N\nmutations are also present in the Omicron variant, thus it\nmay also be resistant to these Abs [ 15 ].\nHigh-potency medications are required that target several\nSARS-CoV-2 variants [ 26 ]. Previously, mAb neutralization\nactivity against variants was assessed by a live-virus focus\nreduction neutralization assay (FRNT) [ 71 ]. The Omicron\nvariant was not neutralized by etesevimab, bamlanivimab\nand imdevimab [ 71 ], while casirivimab demonstrated a\nmuch lower level of Omicron variant neutralization com-\npared with other variants [ 71 ]. The tixagevimab (COV2-\n2196), cilgavimab (COV2-2130), and sotrovimab (S309)\nAbs showed neutralization activity against the Beta, Gamma\nand Omicron variant [ 71 ]; however, activity against the\nOmicron variant was at a much higher concentration [ 71 ].\nCilgavimab and tixagevimab showed a 43-fold decrease in\nneutralizing potency against the Omicron variant [ 45 ].\nThe binding of sotrovimab (S309) or Evusheld were not\ninfluenced by the Omicron variant mutations [ 26 ]. Further-\nmore, sotrovimab has demonstrated effectiveness against\nLimitations and chal- Fig. 2\nlenges with the utilization of\nconventional antibodies\n\n201\nthe Omicron variant ( in vitro ) [ 26 ]. The neutralization\nactivity of certain mAbs is based on targeting regions out-\nside of the RBD or conserved epitopes, which allows the\nmaintenance of effectiveness against several variants [ 26 ],\ne.g. sotrovimab, S2X259, and S2H97 targeting conserved\nepitopes and neutralizing the Omicron variant [ 26 ]. Notably,\nthe authorized mAb treatments for Omicron are sotrovimab\nand Evusheld [ 6 ].\nMost mAbs target the RBD, which can have various\nmutations depending on the SARS-CoV-2 variant [ 25 ]. The\nOmicron variant has several S RBD mutations, which indi-\ncates its potential to escape mAb neutralization [ 15 ]. Muta-\ntions allow the variants, especially Omicron, to resist mAb\nneutralization, thus decreasing mAb efficacy [ 25 ]. Notably,\nutilizing mAbs overcomes the challenges with serum therapy\ndue to mAb specificity, purity, and safety [ 35 ].\nAlthough Abs may be beneficial, some limitations and\nchallenges are experienced with the use of Abs (large size,\nfragile, elevated immunogenicity) (Fig. 2 ) [ 72 ].\nmAb treatments can be useful for patients experienc-\ning mild COVID-19 symptoms [ 16 ]. However, due to\nthe small amount of Ab reaching the target area, large\nrepetitive Ab doses and intravenous administration by\nhealthcare professionals are needed for effective [ 5 ] pre-\nventative/therapeutic effects [ 16 ]. This may indicate the\nlow efficiency of intravenous Ab delivery because these\nlarge Abs will need to move through the plasma–lung\nbarrier in order to treat lung infections [ 5 ]. Addition-\nally, Abs usually only target one epitope at a time [ 16 ].\nThe modification and production of an Ab to contain\nvarious specificities is a slow and strenuous process that\naffects yield and quality [ 12 ]. Somatic mutations and\nAb-dependent enhancement (ADE) are also challenges\nthat may decrease Ab efficacy [ 7 ]. The emergence of\nnumerous SARS-CoV-2 mutations is a big challenge for\ndeveloping therapeutics [ 4 ]. Escape mutants can evade Ab\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n202\nneutralization and host protective immunity [ 4 ]. Notably,\nnumerous anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs are ineffective against\nthe Beta and Gamma variants [ 4 ].\nResearchers are actively developing specific preventive\nand therapeutic strategies (vaccines, mAbs, IFN thera-\npies) for COVID-19 [ 35 ]. Currently, some SARS-CoV-\n2-specific Abs are still under development [ 67 ]. Unfor-\ntunately, the development, evaluation ( in vitro testing\n[neutralizing activity], in vivo testing [protective effec-\ntiveness], preclinical studies and clinical trials [safety and\nefficacy]) and approval of Abs for clinical application is a\nlengthy process (months or years) [ 35 , 67 ]. Moreover, in\nprevious animal models, clinical mAbs have been shown\nto be less efficient as a treatment than a prevention for\nCOVID-19 [ 5 ].\nAlthough mAbs can be beneficial, the various chal-\nlenges, especially their large-scale, labor-intensive,\nlengthy and expensive production, overshadows their\npotential clinical application and limits global accessi-\nbility [ 5 , 35 ]. Therefore novel therapies are required for\ndiseases such as COVID-19 to decrease virus replication,\nvirus spread, disease severity and fatality rates [ 35 ].\n5  \u0007Nanobodies\nNanobodies (VHH or Nbs) are small monomeric antigen-\nbinding fragments generated from heavy chain-only Abs that\nare present in camelids [ 72 ]. There are several advantages\nof Nbs, for example low toxicity, high affinity, sensitivity,\nwater solubility, effortless production, prolonged shelf life,\nand many more (Fig. 3 ) [ 72 ].\nAdvantages of Fig. 3\nnanobodies\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nNbs can be successfully selected from different types of\nlibraries (immune, naïve and synthetic) through several types\nof display technologies (phage, ribosome and yeast surface),\nand expressed in various expression systems (prokaryotic,\neukaryotic and plants) [ 7 ]. Engineering multivalent, bipara-\ntopic and bispecific Nbs with greater efficiency is straight-\nforward [ 12 , 72 ]. Mature Nbs and multivalent Nbs can\nachieve substantial neutralization potency that is equivalent\nto, or greater than (per mass), certain effective SARS-CoV-2\nmAbs [ 5 ]. Notably, the selection and large-scale production\nof specific Nbs can be achieved rapidly and inexpensively,\nwhich allows for high availability [ 72 ].\nNbs can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly,\nor subcutaneously, but inhalation delivery of Nb therapeutics\nis the most attractive option for COVID-19 [ 16 ]. In clini-\ncal specimens, SARS-CoV-2 viral copies was highest in the\nrespiratory system, whereas levels in blood were low [ 73 ].\nMoreover, systemic administration of mAbs results in low\nlevels (0.2%) of the mAb dose reaching the lung [ 74 ]. This\nindicates that therapeutic agents delivered though inhalation\nwould be more favorable than systemic administration [ 74 ].\nIn order for a treatment to be administered through pulmo-\nnary delivery, the treatment (e.g. Abs or Nbs) needs to be\nstable and to maintain structural integrity and bioactivity\n[ 74 ]. Notably, the various advantageous properties of Nbs\n(Fig. 3 ) can allow for successful Nb aerosolization [ 72 ] and\nNbs may be formulated (nebulized spray) to be administered\nthrough inhalation for pulmonary delivery [ 7 , 75 ]. This can\nbe very beneficial regarding respiratory viruses because the\ntreatment can be inhaled directly into lungs, allowing for\ngreater treatment efficacy [ 75 ]. In addition, stable Nbs can\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\nbe engineered into disinfection products for COVID-19 pre-\nvention [ 76 ].\nThe various Nb properties indicate enhanced Nb capabili-\nties [ 7 ] that can overcome many challenges experienced with\nAb utilization. Thus, Nb development against SARS-CoV-2\ncan be very valuable [ 7 ] as the utilization of Nbs may lead to\nefficient targeted treatment delivery (aerosolization), which\nallows for high drug bioavailability, rapid onset of treatment,\nimproved patient compliance and [ 5 ] self-administration.\nTaken together, Nbs possess multiple favorable proper-\nties that translate into advantages in Nb drug development\nfor COVID-19 prophylaxis, diagnostic and therapeutic\npurposes.\n6  \u0007Nanobodies for the Diagnosis, Prevention\nand Treatment of COVID‑19\nThe various Nb attributes offer a great opportunity for\ndeveloping novel diagnosis and treatment interventions for\nCOVID-19. Notably, over the past 3 years there has been\na drastic increase in the generation and evaluation of Nbs\ntargeting SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4 ). The literature was reviewed\nand the potential of several Nbs was noted, resulting in a\ncomprehensive list of various Nbs as well as their diagnostic\nand therapeutic potential (see Table 3 ).\n6.1  \u0007Nanobodies Against SARS‑CoV‑2 as a Diagnostic\nOption for COVID‑19\nWagner et al. generated unique Nbs (NM1228, NM1226\nand NM1230) that have a high RBD affinity (equilibrium\ndissociation constant [ K ] = 1.4–53 nM), potently block\nD\nACE2 binding to SARS CoV 2 antigens (RBD, S1, and ‐ ‐\nNanobodies targeting Fig. 4\nthe S protein (RBD, S1 and\nS2) for COVID-19 diagnosis,\nprevention and therapeutics.\nRBD receptor binding domain,\nCOVID-19 coronavirus disease\n2019\n\n203\nhomotrimeric S protein) [NM1228 50% inhibitory con-\n) = 0.5 nM; NM1226 ­IC = 0.82 nM, and centration ­(IC\n50 50\nNM1230 ­IC = 2.12 nM] and neutralize infection in vitro\n50\n(NM1226 ­IC ~ 15 nM, NM1228 ­IC ~ 7 nM, NM1230\n50 50\n­IC ~ 37 nM and NM1224 ­IC ~ 256 nM)) [ 77 ]. A bipara-\n50 50\ntopic Nb (NM1267) was generated by the fusion of two\nNbs (NM1226 and NM1230) that simultaneously target\ntwo different RBD epitopes [ 77 , 78 ]. The NM1267 demon-\nstrated great improvements in RBD (wild-type and mutants)\naffinity (RBD wild-type ( K ~ 0.5 nM) and RBD mutants\nD\n( K ~ 0.6 nM for ­RBD ; K ~ 1.15 nM for ­RBD ),\nD B.1.1.7 D B.1.351\ninhibition of ACE2 binding to antigens, and effective viral\nneutralization ­(IC ~ 0.9 nM) [ 77 ]. Most serological assays\n50\nare unable to distinguish between total binding Abs and\nneutralizing Abs [ 77 ]. Currently, conventional virus neu-\ntralization tests (VNTs) are used to detect neutralizing Abs\nthat need a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory, handling of\ninfectious SARS CoV 2 virions and excessive amounts of ‐ ‐\ntime (2–4 days) [ 77 ]. Wagner et al. used NM1267 to develop\nthe NeutrobodyPlex, a competitive multiplex binding assay\nthat detects neutralizing Abs and qualitatively and quanti-\ntatively evaluates the immune response in infected and vac-\ncinated patients [ 77 ].\nVarious combinations of biotinylated Nbs (C5, F2, C1,\nH4) were evaluated as capture agents and probe agents in\norder to develop a sandwich ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 [ 22 ].\nIn the ELISA, the biotinx-C5-Fc (capture) and F2-Fc-HRP\n(probe) were shown to be an optimal combination with\nhigh specificity for S protein detection, which led to a limit\n−1 of detection (LOD) of 514 pg ­mL [ 22 ]. The use of site-\nselective biotinylation improved the ELISA sensitivity [ 22 ].\nUsing C5-Fc-SS-biotin as the capture showed increased\n−1 sensitivity to the S protein (147–514 pg ­mL ) and RBD\n−1 (33–85 pg ­mL ). Thus, a sensitive ELISA for SARS-CoV-2\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n204\ndetection was developed using Nbs, indicating the potential\nof Nbs in diagnostics [ 22 ].\nThe process of virus replication is facilitated by the rep-\nlication transcription complex (RTC), which is assembled\nthrough various NSPs [ 79 ]. Notably, Nsp9 is essential for\nRTC assembly and function [ 79 ]. Esposito et al. identi-\nfied 136 Nbs against Nsp9, and eight Nbs were selected for\nexpression and purification [ 79 ]. The 2NSP23 and 2NSP90\nNbs were shown to bind and specifically recognize wild-\n−1 type Nsp9 at low antigen concentrations (1.25 ng µL ) [ 79 ].\nMoreover, both 2NSP23 and 2NSP90 Nbs were shown to\nspecifically bind and detect Nsp9 in saliva from COVID-19\npatients at low concentrations (about 10 ng) [ 79 ]. There-\nfore, the 2NSP23 and 2NSP90 Nbs may be useful to rapidly\nidentify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals indicating its\ndiagnostic potential [ 79 ].\nGransagne et al. generated Nbs that target, specifically\nrecognize and bind with high affinity ( K = 0.206–46.5 nM)\nD\nto the N protein [ 80 ]. The Nbs D12-3, E7-2, E10-3, G9-1\nand H3-3 recognize the C-terminal domain (CTD), while\nNTD E4-3 and NTD B6-1 recognize the NTD [ 80 ]. Affinity\n= 0.206 nM) and lowest binding was highest for E7-2 ( K\nD\nfor NTD B6-1 ( K = 46.5 nM). In infected cell extracts,\nD\nNbs recognized the N protein, with signals ranging from\n4 ng/mL (E7-2) to 4 μg/mL (NTD-B6-1). For N detection,\nNbs against CTD were used in combination with anti-NTD\nNbs to determine the optimal pairing. The Nb pairing of\nG9-1 and NTD-E4-3 produced the best signals (4 ng/mL),\nwhile the NTD E4-3 and G9-1 Nbs detected the N protein\nin B.1.351- and P1-infected mice. In infected cell extracts\n(Wuhan, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants), the NTD E4-3 and\nG9-1 Nbs recognized the N protein. In infected FRhK4 cells\nand Syrian hamsters lung tissue, these Nbs were shown to\nidentify the virus [ 80 ]. A specific and sensitive sandwich\nELISA was developed using the NTD E4-3 and G9-1 Nbs\n[ 80 ]. Notably, the ELISA was shown to detect N protein\nin human nasopharyngeal swab samples [ 80 ]. In addition,\nNTD E4-3 and G9-1 were shown to detect SARS-CoV-2\nvariants [ 80 ].\n6.2  \u0007Nanobodies Against SARS‑CoV‑2\nas a Prevention Option for COVID‑19\nPreviously, Nbs were produced against the major histocom-\npatibility class (MHC) II complex antigens ­(VHH )\nMHCII\n[ 81 ]. Thereafter, Pishesha et al. combined ­VHH with\nMHCII\nSARS-CoV-2 S RBD ­(Spike ) to develop a recombinant\nRBD\nprotein vaccine ­(VHH Spike ) [ 82 ]. Mice immu-\nMHCII- RBD\nnized with ­VHH -Spike (two doses, 20 μg) elicited\nMHCII RBD\nstrong binding and neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2 as\nwell as variants (Wuhan Hu-1+D614G) [ 82 ]. Additionally,\nprominent CD8 T-cell responses were prompted by immu-\nnization [ 82 ]. Notably, the ­VHH -Spike vaccine\nMHCII RBD\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nshowed stability at room temperature, retained efficacy after\nlyophilization, and was produced in high yields [ 82 ]. Hence,\nNbs are a promising option for vaccine development.\nWorldwide, approximately 51% of the population are not\ncompletely vaccinated [ 83 ]. About 1 month is required post-\nvaccination for complete inoculation and effective protection\n[ 83 ]. Thus, short-term instantaneous prophylaxis (STIP) is\nneeded and can be beneficial for unvaccinated individuals\n[ 83 ]. The previously isolated Nb22 Nb showed ultra-potent\nneutralization of the Delta variant, bound to RBDs (origi-\nnal strain and Delta) and effectively blocked RBD-hACE2\nbinding [ 83 ]. Nb22-Fc interacted with the S protein of the\nWH01, D614G, Alpha, and Delta variants. The Nb22-Fc\nshowed a higher neutralizing potency against the Delta\nvariant ­(IC = 5.13 pM) compared with the WH01 ­(IC =\n50 50\n12.63 pM) and Alpha variants ­(IC = 43.13 pM). In post-\n50\nand pre-exposure prophylaxis, intranasal Nb22 (average of\n10 mg/kg) demonstrated protection against the Delta vari-\nant [ 83 ]. Notably in mice, intranasal Nb22 administration\nshowed high efficacy against the Delta variant in STIP (7\ndays, single dose) and lengthy respiratory system retention\n(1 month, four doses) [ 83 ]. Additionally, Nb22 demonstrated\nin vitro room temperature stability (70–80°C, 1 h) and in\nvivo long-lasting retention.\n6.3  \u0007Nanobodies Against SARS‑CoV‑2\nas a Therapeutic Option for COVID‑19\nHuo et al. identified the H11 Nb and two affinity matured\nmutants of H11 (H11-D4 and H11-H4) [ 84 ]. The epitope tar-\ngeted by H11-D4 and H11-H4 is directly next to and slightly\noverlaps the binding region of ACE2 [ 84 ]. Both H11-D4 and\nH11-H4 were shown to inhibit RBD and S from binding to\nACE2 in vitro [ 84 ]. By surface plasmon resonance (SPR),\nRBD binding of H11-H4 had a K of 5 nM and H11-D4 had\nD\na K of 10 nM, whereas by isothermal titration calorimetry\nD\n(ITC), RBD binding of H11-H4 had a K of 12 nM and H11-\nD\nD4 had a K of 39 nM. Furthermore, Nbs can be fused to\nD\nhuman IgG Fc domains [ 85 ]. The RBD binding was blocked\nby H11-H4-Fc ­(IC = 61 nM), H11-D4-Fc ­(IC = 161 nM)\n50 50\nand VHH72-Fc ­(IC = 262 nM) in vitro . In addition, ACE2\n50\nbinding was blocked by H11-H4-Fc ­(IC = 34 nM), H11-\n50\nD4-Fc ­(IC = 28 nM) and VHH72-Fc ­(IC = 33 nM) in\n50 50\nvitro . They were also shown to neutralize live virus, but\nH11-H4-Fc potency was greater [ 84 ]. The 50% neutralizing\ndose ­(ND ) of the virus was 6 nM for H11-H4-Fc and 18 nM\n50\nfor H11-D4-Fc. CR3022 Ab and H11-H4 Nb recognize dif-\nferent epitopes on the RBD, and a combination of these two\nagents have shown additive virus neutralization [ 84 ].\nThe Ty1 Nb demonstrated specific and high-affinity RBD\nbinding ( K 5–10 nM), neutralization of pseudotyped viruses\nD\n(Ty1: ­IC = 0.77 µg/mL; Ty1-Fc: ­IC of ~ 12 ng/mL), bind-\n50 50\ning to RBD in the ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ states as well as\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\ndirect prevention of RBD–ACE2 binding [ 86 ]. For detec-\ntion and diagnostic purposes, Ty1 can be utilized in flow\ncytometry and immunofluorescence [ 86 ]. For therapeutic\npurposes, large quantities of Ty1 can be produced fast and\nat a low cost [ 86 ].\nDong et al. produced multiple Nbs (e.g. 3F, 1B, 2A) that\nblock the SARS-CoV-2–ACE2 interaction, and a combina-\ntion of two Nbs showed synergistic blockage [ 85 ]. In order\nto improve S protein binding affinity, avidity, and block-\nage of the interaction, multiple different high-affinity Nbs\nthat target different but adjacent RBD epitopes can be\nfused into a multispecific Nb [ 85 ]. Notably, at therapeuti-\ncally relevant concentrations, S protein binding and block-\nade of the S–ACE2 interaction was significantly enhanced\nby the bi-specific Nb-fc ( K = 0.25 nM, ­IC 36.7 nM, ∼\nD 100\n­IC 12.2 nM, ­IC 1 nM) compared with the monoclo- ∼ ∼\n95 50\nnal Nb-Fc [ 85 ]. The bi-specific 1B-3F Nb-Fc demonstrated\nincreased binding to S1 RBD and S–ACE2 blockade [ 87 ].\n3F-Fc and 2A-Fc likely bind to different S1 RBD epitopes,\nwhereas 1B-Fc and 2A-Fc may bind to the same S1 RBD\n[ 87 ] epitope. 3F-Fc does not compete with 1B-Fc or 2A-Fc,\nand likely binds to a different epitope [ 87 ]. Thereafter, sev-\neral tri-specific Nb-Fc were constructed that demonstrated\na further enhancement in efficacy [ 87 ]. The tri-specific\nNb-Fc, 3F-1B-2A, showed extremely strong binding of\nS1 RBD, blockage of the S–ACE2 interaction and inhi-\nbition of pseudovirus infection in vitro [ 87 ]. In vitro , tri-\n~ 0.047 nM] and 1B-3F-2A specific Nbs (3F-1B-2A [ K\nD\n[ K ~ 0.095 nM]) demonstrated higher binding affinities\nD\nto S1 RBD than 1B-3F [ 87 ]. Additionally, tri-specific Nbs\n(3F-1B-2A [0.71 nM], 1B-3F-2A [0.74 nM], and full inhibi-\ntion [10 nM]) blocked the S–ACE2 interaction to a greater\nextent than mono-specific Nb-Fcs in combination ­(IC =\n50\n2.21 nM, and full inhibition around 100 nM) [ 87 ]. Similarly,\nthe tri-specific Nb-Fcs (3F-1B-2A, ­IC = 3.00 nM; and\n50\n1B-3F-2A, ­IC = 6.44 nM) neutralized pseudovirus infec-\n50\ntion more effectively than the combination of VHH-Fcs (1B,\n3F and 2A, ­IC = 29.19 nM) [ 87 ].\n50\nThree sybody (Sb) libraries (concave, loop and convex)\nwere used to rapidly select various Sbs against SARS-\nCoV-2 RBD [ 88 ]. The potent Sb23 showed high RBD bind-\ning affinity ( K = 10 nM) and effectively neutralized pseu-\nD\ndovirus ­(IC = 0.6 µg/mL) [ 88 ]. Notably, the RBD affinity\n50\n( K = 225 pM) and neutralization efficiency (~ 100-fold,\nD\n­IC = 0.007 µg/mL) was drastically enhanced by the biva-\n50\nlent Sb23-Fc construct [ 88 ]. Sb23 showed higher RBD\naffinity than ACE2, competes with ACE2 for RBD binding\nsites, and binds to RBD in the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conforma-\ntion, therefore effectively blocking the SARS-CoV-2–ACE2\ninteraction [ 88 ]. Additionally, Sb23 could be combined with\nother Sbs (Sb12, 76, and 100) that simultaneously bind RBD\nand decrease ACE2 binding affinity [ 88 ].\n\n205\nPreviously, synthetic Nbs that effectively disrupt the\nS–ACE2 interaction and inhibit pseudovirus infection\nwere produced [ 11 ]. Nb6 and Nb11 targeted the RBD\nand impeded ACE2 binding, while Nb3 targeted different\nepitopes and reduced the S–ACE2 interaction. Nb6 binds to\nS2P ­Spike ( K = 210nM) and to RBD alone ( K = 41 nM),\nD D\nS2P whereas Nb3 binds to ­Spike ( K = 61 nM), but there\nD\nwas no indication of binding to the RBD alone [ 11 ]. Nb6\nand Nb11 were shown to be the most potent clones, with\n­IC values of 370 and 540 nM, respectively. They recognize\n50\nRBD epitopes overlapping the binding site of ACE2 [ 11 ] and\nS2P bind to open and closed ­Spike conformations. Pseudovi-\nrus infection was inhibited by Nb6 ­(IC = 2.0 µM), Nb11\n50\n­(IC = 2.4 μM) and Nb3 ­(IC = 3.9 μM). Nb6 dimerization\n50 50\nand trimerization lead to increases in K of 750-fold and\nD\nK of > 200,000-fold, respectively. A trivalent Nb6 (Nb6-\nD\ntri) Nb was generated to improve the affinity and inhibitory\neffects. The Nb6-tri was extremely potent and neutralized\nlive SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of pseudovirus infection was\n= enhanced to a greater extent by Nb6-tri (2000-fold, ­IC\n50\n1.2 nM) than Nb11-tri (40-fold, ­IC = 51 nM) and Nb3-tri\n50\n(10-fold, ­IC = 400 nM). In the neutralization of live virus\n50\ninfection, Nb6-tri ­(IC = 160 pM) demonstrated greater\n50\npotency than Nb3-tri ­(IC = 140 nM). Thereafter, potency\n50\nwas optimized by the selection of high-affinity mutations,\nwhich led to the production of a mature Nb6 (mNb6). The\nmNb6 showed enhanced binding affinity (500-fold affinity to\nS2P ­Spike ), inhibition of pseudovirus, and live virus infection\n(~ 200-fold). The inhibitory effects were further enhanced\nby the trivalent mNb6 (mNb6-tri), and the neutralization of\nSARS-CoV-2 is due to mNb6-tri locking S into an inactive\nformat [ 11 ]. The mNb6-tri further enhances the inhibition of\npseudovirus ­(IC = 120 pM or 5.0 ng/mL) and live infection\n50\n­(IC = 54 pM or 2.3 ng/mL). Interestingly, mNb6-tri was\n50\nshown to remain stable and functional after heat treatment,\nlyophilization, and aerosolization. This indicates the poten-\ntial of mNb6-tri to be aerosolically delivered directly into the\nlungs, which may allow for patient-friendly administration\nof a preventative/therapeutic drug against COVID-19 [ 11 ].\nThree high-quality potent Nbs (Nb21, Nb20 and Nb89)\ndemonstrated high affinities, pseudovirus neutralization, and\nthermostability (Nb89 = 65.9°, Nb20 = 71.8°, and Nb21 =\n72.8°C) [ 89 ]. Interestingly, three copies of Nb20 or Nb21\nshowed simultaneous binding of all three RBDs in the inac-\ntive ‘down’ conformation [ 89 ]. The SPR showed the binding\naffinities of Nb89 (108 pM) and Nb20 (10.4 pM). Pseudovi-\nrus was neutralized by Nb89 (0.133 nM), Nb20 (0.102 nM),\nand Nb21 (0.045 nM). Moreover, live virus was neutralized\nby Nb89 (0.154 nM), Nb20 (0.048 nM), and Nb21 (0.022\nnM). The Nb21 on-shelf stability after purification was ~ 6\nweeks at room temperature. In comparison with the mono-\nmeric Nbs, the homotrimeric Nbs ­(Nb21 and ­Nb20 ) dem-\n3 3\nonstrated an enhanced (~ 30-fold) inhibition of pseudovirus\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n206\n­(Nb21 , ­IC = 1.3 pM; and ­Nb20 , ­IC = 4.1 pM) [ 89 ].\n3 50 3 50\nNotably, the multivalent constructs showed good physico-\nchemical properties (solubility and thermostability) and high\npseudovirus neutralization capabilities even after lyophiliza-\ntion and aerosolization, indicating the potential for aerosol-\nmediated administration [ 89 ]. Combining various multiva-\nlent constructs that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 could\ninhibit mutational escape [ 89 ].\nLi et al. also produced several unique Sbs [ 90 ]. The potent\nMR3 binds the RBD ( K = 1.0 nM), neutralizes the pseu-\nD\n-1 dovirus ­(IC = 0.40 μg ­mL ) and competes with ACE2 for\n50\nRBD binding [ 90 ]. On the other hand, SR31 demonstrated\nhigh RBD binding ( K = 5.6 nM) but no neutralizing activi-\nD\nties [ 90 , 91 ]. Yao et al. then revealed the potential of SR31 as\na fusion partner for enhancing Nb potency [ 91 ]. Two mod-\nestly neutralizing Sbs (MR17 and MR6) were fused to SR31\n[ 91 ]. In comparison with MR6 ( K = 23.2 nM and ­IC =\nD 50\n77.5 nM) and MR17 ( K = 83.7 nM and ­IC = 747 nM),\nD 50\nthe MR6-SR31 and MR17-SR31 conjugates were shown to\n= 0.3 substantially enhance RBD affinity (MR17-SR31: K\nD\nnM; and MR6-SR31: K = 0.5 nM) and pseudovirus neu-\nD\ntralization (MR17-SR31: ­IC = 52.8 nM and MR6-SR31:\n50\n­IC = 2.7 nM) [ 91 ].\n50\nFour Nbs (VHH E [ K = 2 nM], VHH U [ K = 21 nM],\nD D\nVHH V [ K = 9 nM], and VHH W [ K = 22 nM]) were\nD D\nshown to target the RBD and potently neutralized infection\n[ 12 ]. These Nbs showed good live virus neutralizing activity\n­(IC = 48–185 nM). VHH E, which binds RBD in the ‘up’\n50\nconformation, was the most potent, and results suggest that\nVHH E induces the three ‘up’ conformations and causes the\n‘down’ conformation to be inaccessible to the RBD [ 12 ].\nEngineered multivalent Nbs (VHH EE and EEE) showed\ngreater neutralizing activities (100 times) [ 12 ]. Both VHH\nEE and VHH EEE showed enhanced neutralization of the\npseudotyped virus (EE ­IC = 930 pM; and EEE ­IC = 520\n50 50\npM) and live wild-type virus ­(IC = 180–170 pM). Moreo-\n50\nver, a mixture of two Nbs that bind to different epitopes\ndemonstrated enhanced neutralization and prevention of\nreplication [ 12 ]. Notably, biparatopic Nbs (VHH VE and\nEV) showed substantially higher (more than eight times)\nbinding strength (VE [ K = 84 pM] and EV [ K = 200 pM])\nD D\nand pseudotyped VSV neutralization (VE and EV, ­IC =\n50\n4.1–2.9 nM) than E alone [ 12 ]. Targeting two neutralizing\nepitopes simultaneously with biparatopic Nbs inhibits the\nemergence of escape mutants [ 12 ].\nGai et al. produced six Nbs that showed good binding\ncapacity ( K = 21.6–106 nM) to S RBD wild-type and\nD\neight mutants (Q321L, V341I, N354D, V367F, K378R,\nV483A, Y508H, and H519P), and also blocked the inter-\naction between the eight mutants of RBD and ACE2\n[ 92 ]. There were varying levels of RBD–ACE2 block-\ning activity for Nb8 87 (16.2%), Nb13 58 (50.4%), and ‐ ‐\nNb11 59 (98.9%). All Nbs had half maximal neutralization ‐\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nconcentrations ­(EC ) and ­IC values lower than 0.2 and\n50 50\n1 μg/mL, respectively. Notably, Nb16 68 ­(ND = 2.2 μg/ ‐\n50\nmL) and Nb11 59 ­(ND = 0.55 μg/mL) demonstrated ‐\n50\nthe most effective neutralizing activity against authentic\nvirus [ 92 ]. The Nb11 59 was humanized (HuNb11 59) and ‐ ‐\nexpressed in Pichia pastoris , which produced extremely\nlarge amounts (20 g/L titer) of HuNb11 59 in minimal ‐\ntime (213 h) [ 92 ]. Thereafter, HuNb11 59 showed high ‐\npurity (99.36%), great stability, and neutralization activ-\nity, indicating potential inhalation delivery and successful\ncommercialization [ 92 ].\nThe Pittsburgh inhalable Nb 21 (PiN-21) is an extremely\npotent homotrimeric construct that demonstrated efficient\nprevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [ 5 ]. In the\nrespiratory tract of Syrian hamsters, intranasal PiN-21 (0.6\nmg/kg) delivery substantially inhibited viral replication [ 5 ].\nTherefore, the beneficial effects of PiN-21 in vitro was also\nseen in vivo [ 5 ]. Aerosol PiN-21 (~ 0.2 mg/kg) delivery\nextremely decreased viral load and prevented pneumonia and\nlung damage in Syrian hamsters [ 5 ]. Thus, human-to-human\nvirus transmission may be restricted by aerosol-mediated Nb\nadministration [ 5 ]. The administration of PiN-21 through\ninhalation at an early stage of disease was shown to effec-\ntively reduce virus entry and replication, indicating disease\nprevention [ 5 ]. Thus, PiN-21 showed great efficacy for the\nprevention and treatment of COVID-19 [ 5 ].\nPymm et al. identified several high affinity Nbs (WNb 2,\n= 0.14–19.49 nM]) that WNb 7, WNb 15, and WNb 36 [ K\nD\ndisrupted the RBD–ACE2 interaction and neutralized the\nvirus (3–36108 nM) [ 17 ]. The Nb-Fc fusions bind to dis-\ntinct antigenic sites on RBD (nM), inhibit ACE2–RBD\ninteraction, and bind to most RBD variants ­(EC 0.7–14\n50\nnM). Nb-Fc (WNb 2, 7, 15, and 36) binds to wild-type RBD\n­(EC = 0.97–2.65 nM), but showed decreased binding to\n50\neither E484K or N501Y variant RBDs. The Nb-Fc fusions\nbind to wild-type RBD and the N501Y variant at K < 0.55\nD\nnM. The Nb-Fc 2 inhibited wild-type ­(IC = 0.16–0.61\n50\nnM) and most RBD variants ­(IC = 0.04–1.8 nM) and\n50\nRBD–ACE2 engagement. The potent Nb-Fcs were shown\nto impede the interaction between variants (N501Y, and to\na greater extent, E484K ­[IC = 0.04–0.19 nM]) RBD and\n50\nACE2 and potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (wild-type ­[IC\n50\n= 0.10–3.18 nM] and N501Y D614G ­[IC = 0.11–5.04\n50\nnM] variants) [ 17 ]. Additionally, in N501Y D614G variant-\ninfected mice, prophylactic Nb-Fc (alone or in combination)\nadministration decreased viral loads, indicating their poten-\ntial for COVID-19 prevention [ 17 ].\nVHH-72 Nb was generated against SARS-CoV-1 RBD,\nhowever VHH-72 was able to cross-react with the SARS-\nCoV-2 RBD [ 75 ]. VHH-72 binds to SARS-CoV-1 RBD\nwith an affinity of 1.2 nM, whereas for SARS-CoV-2 RBD,\nthe K was ~ 39 nM. The VHH-72 Nb was shown to com-\nD\npetitively [ 14 ] bind RBD with high affinity, however its\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nPotential of Nanobodies for COVID-19 Diagnostics and Therapeutics\nneutralization of S pseudotypes was at a high ­IC [ 75 ].\n50\nTherefore, the bivalent VHH-72-Fc was constructed and\nshowed enhanced RBD binding affinity as well as neutraliza-\ntion of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses at a low ­IC of 0.2 μg/\n50\nmL [ 75 ]. In comparison with CR3022, VHH-72 prevents\nACE2–SARS-CoV-2 binding [ 75 ]. Thereafter, multivalent\nVHH-72 Nbs were engineered in order to enhance neutrali-\nzation activities [ 14 ]. The VHH 72 demonstrated binding ‐\naffinity ( K = 29–60 n ) for wild type and variants (UK and ‐\nm D\nSA). The tetravalent and hexavalent VHH 72 demonstrated ‐\nsubstantial synergistic increases in neutralization efficacy\n[ 14 ]. The neutralization potency of VHH 72 increased with ‐\nthe increase in valency, as seen with the bivalent VHH 72 ‐\n­(IC = ± 3.3 n M), the tetravalent ­(IC = ± 0.34 n M ) and\n50 50\nthe hexavalent ­(IC = ± 0.035 n M ) against the wild-type.\n50\nNotably, the hexavalent VHH 72 demonstrated potent pseu- ‐\ndovirus neutralization of the UK ­(IC = ± 0.31 n M ) and\n50\nSA ­(IC = ± 0.072 n M ) variants as well as the wild type ‐\n50\n[ 14 ]. Interestingly, the neutralizing potency of the multi-\n= ± valent VHH-72 could be greater than the S309 ­(IC\n50\n1.9 n ) mAb [ 14 ]. In addition, the multivalent VHH 72 Nbs ‐\nm\ndemonstrated advantageous biophysical properties (low off ‐\ntarget binding, high stability and solubility), indicating their\npotential as therapeutic agents [ 14 ].\nThe Nanosota-1A Nb showed excessive neutralization\npotency, and affinity maturation resulted in Nanosota-\n1B and then Nanosota-1C [ 48 ]. Nanosota-1A , -1B , and\n-1C bind RBD with increasing affinity ( K = 228–14 nM)\nd\nand effectively inhibit viral infection in vitro . Furthermore,\nNanosota-1 strongly neutralizes pseudoviruses bearing the\nD614G mutation [ 48 ]. Nanosota-1C was shown to access the\nS protein in the accessible and inaccessible states [ 48 ]. Both\nNanosota-1C and Nanosota-1C-Fc compete with ACE2 to\nbind RBD [ 48 ]. In order to inhibit the virus–ACE2 bind-\ning, a Nb needs to bind to RBD more strongly than ACE2\n[ 48 ]. In comparison with ACE2, Nanosota-1C-Fc did in\nfact bind more strongly. Notably, Nanosota-1C-Fc binds\nRBD with the highest affinity ( K = 15.7 pM) and ~ 3000\nd\ntimes tighter than ACE2 [ 48 ]. Both Nanosota-1C-Fc and\nNanosota-1C potently inhibited pseudovirus entry as well\nas live virus infection [ 48 ]. Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated\npotent pseudovirus neutralization ­(ND = 0.27 μg/mL and\n50\n­ND = 3.12 μg/mL), which was ~ 10 times greater than\n90\nNanosota-1C and ~ 160 times greater than ACE2. Nanosota-\n1C-Fc also potently neutralizes live virus infection ­(ND =\n50\n0.16 μg/mL), again to a greater extent than Nanosota-1C and\nACE2. In vivo , in hamster and mouse models, Nanosota-\n1C-Fc (10–20 mg/kg) showed preventive as well as thera-\npeutic effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 live infection [ 48 ].\nAdditionally, Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated exceptional\nthermostability (−80°C, 4°C, 25°C, or 37°C for 1 week),\nin vivo stability (10 days) and tissue bioavailability (after 3\n\n207\ndays) [ 48 ]. Therefore, Nanosota-1C-Fc may be an effective\nand inexpensive treatment against COVID-19 [ 48 ].\nHuo et al. produced four Nbs (C5, H3, C1, F2) with high\nbinding affinity ( K = 20–615 pM) and demonstrated that\nD\nACE2 binding was blocked by C1, H3 and C5, whereas it\nwas unaffected by F2 [ 93 ]. C1 and F2 were shown to bind\nto the Alpha, Beta and Victoria strains at similar affini-\nties, whereas C5 and H3 were shown to bind to only the\nAlpha and Victoria strain, and not the Beta strain. [ 93 ]. The\nC5 binds to RBD ( K = ± 210 pM) and S ( K = ± 350 pM)\nD D\nwith high affinity and neutralized the Victoria ­(IC =\n50\n18 pM) and Alpha ­(IC = 25 pM) strains. The C1 was active\n50\nagainst the Beta strain. Trimeric (C5, C1 and H3) Nbs bind\nto RBD at an enhanced K (10- to 100-fold) and showed\nD\npotent virus (Victoria, Alpha or Beta strains) neutralization\n[ 93 ]. The C5 trimer showed enhanced neutralization potency\nagainst the live Victoria strain ­(ND = 3 pM), and C5-Fc\n50\nshowed RBD binding affinity ( K = 37 pM) and virus neu-\nD\n= 2 pM) similar to the trivalent tralization potency ­(ND\n50\nC5. Regarding RBD binding, C1 and F2 competed with\nCR3022, whereas C5 and H3 competed with H11-H4. In the\nSyrian hamster model, intraperitoneal (IP) administration of\nC5-Fc (4 mg/kg) showed therapeutic efficacy [ 93 ]. Addition-\nally, in the hamster model, IP and intranasal administration\nof the trimeric C5 Nb showed therapeutic benefit [ 93 ].\nWu et al. isolated three Nbs ­(Nb -Fc, ­Nb -Fc, and\n15 22\n­Nb -Fc) that showed specific RBD binding ( K =\n31 D\n1.13–1.76 nM) and potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2\n(live virus ­[IC = 41.3–75 pM and ­IC = 195–293.8 pM]\n50 90\nand pseudovirus ­[IC = 10–28.8 pM]) [ 74 ]. The three Nb-\n50\nFcs did not inhibit MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudovi-\nrus. Interestingly these Nb-Fcs inhibited 15 SARS-CoV-2\nvariants. All three Nb-Fcs inhibited the replication of\nSARS-CoV-2 variants with a D614G mutation. Notably,\nthe bivalent ­Nb ­(IC = 11 pM), trivalent ­Nb ­(IC =\n15 50 15 50\n9.0 pM), and tetravalent ­Nb ­(IC = 4.3 pM) showed\n15 50\nenhanced neutralization potency compared with mono-\nmeric ­Nb ­(IC = 2.3 nM). Thereafter, a heterotrimeric\n15 50\nand bispecific Nb ­(Nb -Nb -Nb ) was engineered in order\n15 H 15\nto enhance efficacy [ 74 ]. This construct contained a Nb spe-\ncific for human serum albumin (HSA) ­[Nb ] and two ­Nb\nH 15\nspecific for RBD [ 74 ]. ­Nb -Nb -Nb showed substantially\n15 H 15\nelevated neutralization efficacy (pM) against wild-type and\n18 mutant variants ( in vitro ), as well as excellent thermal\nstability (70–80°C, 1 h) [ 74 ]. ­Nb -Nb -Nb demonstrated\n15 H 15\nspecific RBD ( K = 0.54 nM) and HSA ( K = 7.7 nM)\nD D\nbinding. Moreover, it was potent against the pseudotyped\nvariants with D614G and N501Y mutations (UK and SA).\n­Nb -Nb -Nb showed neutralization against the pseudo-\n15 H 15\ntyped variants wild-type ­(IC = 9.0 pM), Alpha ­(IC =\n50 50\n5.9 pM) and Delta ­(IC =116 pM), but failed to neutral-\n50\nize the Gamma and Beta variants. Among various admin-\nistration routes (intranasal, intraperitoneal, intravenous),\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n208\nthe intranasal ­Nb -Nb -Nb administration was the most\n15 H 15\nfavorable route, resulting in high and sustained (7 days)\nlevels of ­Nb -Nb -Nb in lungs ( in vivo ) [ 74 ]. Nota-\n15 H 15\nbly, in transgenic human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, intrana-\nsal ­Nb -Nb -Nb (average of 10 mg/kg) administration\n15 H 15\nshowed substantial prophylactic and therapeutic efficiency\nagainst viral infection [ 74 ].\nGuttler et al. produced various Nbs (e.g. Re6B06,\nRe9F06, Re5D06) that completely prevent infection\n[ 4 ]. Several of these Nbs demonstrated neutralization,\nhyper-thermostability, binding of S protein in the active\nand inactive states, and tight RBD binding [ 4 ]. Addi-\ntionally, Nb tandems were constructed and Nb mono-\nmers were identified that keenly binds RBD which pos-\nsess a mixture of escape mutations (K417T, E484K,\nN501Y, L452R), indicating high mutational tolerance\n[ 4 ]. Re5D06 ( K ˜2 pM), Re9B09 ( K ≤1 pM), Re6H06\nD D\n( K ≤1 pM), Re5F10 (˜30 pM), Re9H01 (˜10 pM), and\nD\nRe9H03 (˜25 pM) showed tight RBD binding. Some\nNbs neutralize in the low nM range, such as Re9F06\n(17 nM), Re5F10 (5 nM), Re6B07 (5 nM), and Re6B06\n(50 nM), whereas other Nbs neutralize in the pM range,\ni.e. Re9B09, Re9H01, Re9H03 (167 pM), Re5D06 and\nRe6H06 (50 pM) [ 4 ]. Re5D06, Re6H06 or Re9B09 block\nthe ACE2–RBD interaction, while Re5F10, Re7E02 or\nRe9F06 also competed with ACE2. Re9B09 and Re5D06,\nRe9F06 and Re5F10 are hyperthermostable (90°C,\n5 min) or can robustly refold after heat treatment. The\ntrimerization of Nbs decreased the minimal neutraliza-\ntion concentration (Re9F06 =167 pM; Re6D06 = 17 pM)\n[ 4 ]. The Re5D06–RBD model can accommodate the\nN501Y exchange, and the combination of mutations Beta\n(K417N, E484K, N501Y) or Gamma (K417T, E484K,\n= N501Y) decreased the Re5D06–RBD interaction ( K\nD\n0.1–0.5 nM).\nFusion of Re9F06 to R28 lead to a tandem that binds\nrapidly to the Beta and Gamma variants. A quadruple\n(K417T, L452R, E484K, N501Y) RBD mutant that\ncontains several mutations was produced. The Re9F06 ‐\nR28 tandem was shown to bind to the mutated variants.\nRe6H06 showed ≤ 10 pM binding to either the Beta\nor Gamma, and Re9H03 binds mostly irreversibly to\nGamma, Beta variants, and the quadruple mutant. Lastly,\nthere was potent B.1.351 neutralization by monomers\n(Re5F10 [1.7 nM], Re6H06 [170 pM], Re9B09 [1.7 nM],\nRe9H03 [50–170 pM]) and tandems (Re9F06 R28 [50 ‐\npM], Re9F06 Re9B09 [50 pM], and Re9F06 Re6H06 ‐ ‐\n[17 pM] [ 4 ].\nThe K-874A Nb was generated and binds specifically\nto the S1 protein with high affinity ( K = 1.4 nM) and\nd\nneutralizes the B.1.1.7 variant ­(IC = ± 5.74 μg/mL),\n50\nbut not the other variants [ 94 ]. Interestingly, the K-874A\nNb does not reduce/prevent viral attachment to the ACE2\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\n[ 94 ]. Instead, K-874A blocks the fusion between the\nvirus membrane and the host cell, which inhibits viral\nentry [ 94 ]. In infected Syrian hamsters, intranasal admin-\nistration of K-874A (30 mg/kg) was shown to decrease\nviral RNA copies in the lungs and inhibit the increase of\ncytokine levels [ 94 ].\nAnother biparatopic Nb (NM1268) was produced\n(NM1228 and NM1226) that targets different epitopes\ninside the RBD–ACE2 interface [ 78 ]. Both NM1267 and\nNM1268 showed strong RBD binding affinity. NM1268\ndemonstrated picomolar affinities to ­RBD , block-\nB.1\nage of the ACE2–antigen interaction at low picomolar\nrange, high stability and production at a high purity and\nyield [ 78 ]. Both biparatopic Nbs efficiently bind with\nhigh affinity to several variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma,\nDelta) and were shown to neutralize the Beta and Delta\nvariants in vitro [ 78 ]. NM1267 neutralized B.1 ­(IC =\n50\n0.33nM), B.1.351 ­(IC = 0.78  nM) and B.1.617.2\n50\n= 52.55 nM). NM1268 showed strong neutraliza- ­(IC\n50\ntion potency for B.1 ­(IC = 2.37 nM), B.1.351 ­(IC =\n50 50\n6.06 nM), and B.1.617.2 ­(IC = 0.67 nM). Addition-\n50\nally, in K18-hACE2 mice, the prophylactic intranasal\nNM1267 and NM1268 Nb (20 µg) treatment was shown\nto inhibit virus-induced (B.1, B.1.351 or B.1.617.2)\ninfection, virus shedding, disease progression and mor-\ntality [ 78 ]. Prophylactic NM1267 treatment decreased\nlung tissue damage induced by virus and inflammation\nin B.1 infected mice. ‐\nThe potent NIH-CoVnb-112 Nb demonstrated strong\nbinding affinity (4.9 nM) to S RBD and effectively inter-\nferes with the S RBD–ACE2 interaction with a ­EC of\n50\n0.02 µg/mL [ 95 ]. Notably, the affinity of monomeric\nNIH-CoVnb-112 was substantially better than other\nmonomeric Nbs (VHH72, Ty1, Sb#14, and Sb23) [ 95 ]. In\ncomparison with the S RBD wild-type, many variants of\nS RBD (N354D D364Y, V367F, and W436R) have shown\nextremely higher affinity for ACE2 (100-fold) in vitro\n[ 95 ]. Remarkably, NIH-CoVnb-112 binding affinity to\nthese variants, as well as its ability to block the interac-\ntion between the variants and ACE2, were similar to its\neffects with the wild-type S RBD [ 95 ]. In vitro , pseudo-\ntyped lentivirus infection was shown to be blocked by\nNIH-CoVnb-112 [ 95 ]. Interestingly, NIH-CoVnb-112\nand VHH-72 bind to different epitopes and their combi-\nnation led to additive effects [ 95 ]. Post-nebulization of\nNIHCoVnb-112 showed that a large percentage (> 90%)\nof total input protein was recovered, it maintains effec-\ntiveness and there was no sign of degradation/aggrega-\ntion products following exposure to physiological tem-\nperature (37°C, 24 h). NIH-CoVnb-112 also showed\nvariant neutralization of Alpha ­(EC = 9.4 nM), Beta\n50\n­(EC = 15.8 nM), Gamma ­(EC = 17.6 nM), and Delta\n50 50\n­(EC = 14.5 nM) in vitro [ 95 ].\n50\n\n--- Page 17

The 8A2 Nb\n50\nhinders ACE2 binding to RBD in active conformation,\nwhereas the 7A3 Nb binds the active and inactive con-\nformation [ 97 ]. In the K18-hACE2 mouse model, 7A3\nprotects mice against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, indicat-\ning its therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 [ 97 ].\nMoreover, 7A3 ­V H-hFc or 7A3+8A2 (5 mg/kg) protect\nH\nK18-hACE2 mice against lethal B.1.351 infection; how-\never, the protective efficiency of 7A3+8A2 (5 mg/kg)\nwas decreased by 50% in K18-hACE2 mice exposed to a\nlethal dose of B.1.617.2.\nSeveral studies investigated the effects of Nbs using\nin vitro neutralization assays (pseudo and live virus) and\nin vivo testing (Table 2 ). Comparing these studies, the\nFc-MR17 Nb ( K < 1 pM) showed the most potent bind-\nD\ning affinity, followed by aRBD-2-5-Fc ( K = 12.3 pM)\nD\nand C5-Fc ( K = 37 pM).

Unfortunately,\nthese challenges may negatively impact worldwide acces-\nsibility of COVID-19 diagnosis tests and treatments [ 5 ].\nNotably, Nbs are an advantageous diagnostic and ther-\napeutic option. The utilization of Nbs may overcome the\nchallenges faced with current detection assays and medi-\ncines. Additionally, the potential aerosolization and inha-\nlation delivery of Nbs allows for targeted treatment deliv-\nery as well as patient self-administration. Notably, Nbs\ncan be rapidly and inexpensively generated, modified,\ntested ( in vitro and in vivo ), produced in large quantities,\nand developed into diagnosis tests as well as treatments.\nAlthough most SARS-CoV-2 Nbs have demonstrated\nhigh neutralization potency in vitro , further research\nis required to determine whether in vitro Nb potency is\ntranslated into in vivo and clinical therapeutic efficacy\n[ 5 , 9 ]. Taken together, Nbs are proving to be a highly\npromising diagnosis and treatment option for COVID-19.\nThe authors are grateful to the National Research Acknowledgements\nfoundation (120792 and 120820), SAMRC (JAF # 2020/127) and Uni-\nversity of KwaZulu-Natal for financial support.\nDeclarations\nThis research was funded by the National Research founda- Funding\ntion (grant numbers 120792 and 120820), SAMRC (JAF # 2020/127),\nand University of KwaZulu-Natal.\nDhaneshree Bestinee Naidoo and Anil Amichund Conflict of interest\nChuturgoon declare they have no conflicts of interest.\nNot applicable.

Unfortunately, the virus has been\ntification/development of various diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction and antigen tests) and treatment (repurposed drugs,\nconvalescent plasma, antibodies and vaccines) options. These treatments may treat mild symptoms and decrease the risk of\nlife-threatening disease. Although these options have been fairly beneficial, there are some challenges and limitations, such\nas cost of tests/drugs, specificity, large treatment dosages, intravenous administration, need for trained personal, lengthy\n19 diagnostic and therapeutic options are vital. Nanobodies (Nbs) are novel monomeric antigen-binding fragments derived\nfrom camelid antibodies. Advantages of Nbs include low immunogenicity, high specificity, stability and affinity. These\ncharacteristics allow for rapid Nb generation, inexpensive large-scale production, effective storage, and transportation, which\nis essential during pandemics. Additionally, the potential aerosolization and inhalation delivery of Nbs allows for targeted\ntreatment delivery as well as patient self-administration. Therefore, Nbs are a viable option to target SARS-CoV-2 and\novercome COVID-19. In this review we discuss (1) COVID-19; (2) SARS-CoV-2; (3) the present conventional COVID-19\ndiagnostics and therapeutics, including their challenges and limitations; (4) advantages of Nbs; and (5) the numerous Nbs\n1  \u0007Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID‑19)\nCoronaviruses are a part of the Coronaviridae family, and the\nfirst human coronaviruses (HCoV) were identified around\nthe 1960s [ 1 ]. Coronavirus infections can be endemic\n(HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63 and -HKU1), which causes the\ncommon cold/mild illness, as well as epidemic (severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], SARS-\nCoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n[MERS-CoV]), which may cause lethal respiratory infec-\ntions [ 1 ]. These viruses emerge periodically and are associ-\nated with major outbreaks [ 2 ]. In November 2002, SARS-\nCoV-1 appeared and caused worldwide infection, with a\n10% lethal rate [ 2 , 3 ]. Thereafter, in June 2012, MERS-CoV\nemerged and showed a 35% lethal rate [ 2 , 3 ].\nMore recently, in December 2019, severe acute res-\npiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged\nin Wuhan, China [ 1 , 3 ]. This highly contagious virus has\nswiftly spread throughout the globe, leading to coronavirus\nVol.:(0123456789)",

There have been more than 585 mil-\nlion COVID-19 cases and more than 6 million fatalities [ 6 ]\nworldwide [ 4 , 5 ]. Virus transmission may occur through\ndirect contact with infected individuals and exposure to\nSARS-CoV-2-contaminated liquid droplets, surfaces and\nmaterials [ 3 ]. Infected individuals may be asymptomatic\n(absence of all symptoms) or symptomatic (presence of\nsymptoms) [ 7 ]. The common symptoms are fever (87%),\ncough (67%), shortness of breath, loss of taste, and fatigue\n(38%) [ 1 , 3 ]. However, COVID-19 may worsen, resulting in\npneumonia, multi-organ failure, and loss of life [ 1 , 3 ].\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many challenges\nto the human population, healthcare systems, and economic\nand social activities [ 8 ]. Notably, the global economic cost\nof the pandemic is over $10.3 trillion [ 9 ]. Initially, the world\nrelied heavily on the implementation of protective/preventa-\ntive measures as it is imperative to control virus transmission\nroutes and infection sources [ 3 ]. These measures included\ndecreased mass gatherings, use of protective gear (masks),\neffective sanitization, maintenance of personal hygiene,\nsocial distancing (2 meters), and a healthy diet/lifestyle (suf-\nficient nutrition and vitamins) [ 3 ].\nPopulation protective immunity or herd immunity refers\nto a high percentage of a population that is immune to a\nparticular disease [ 7 ] with immunity being attained through\ninfection or vaccination [ 7 ]. For COVID-19, approximately\n67% of a population should be immunized to achieve herd\nimmunity, which can potentially decrease the spread of\ndisease [ 7 ]. Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been\ndeveloped, tested and administered in an attempt to reach\npopulation immunity, however the efficacy of vaccines are\nnegatively affected by the emergence of various strains [ 7 ].\nCurrently, several COVID-19 treatment options are avail-\nable [ 1 , 3 ]. Drug repurposing and in vitro inhibition have\ndetermined drugs that can be used [ 1 ], and some drugs/\nGeneral structure of Fig. 1\nSARS-CoV-2 and function\nof structural proteins. SARS-\nCoV-2 severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus-2\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nantibodies (Abs) have been approved by the US FDA for\nCOVID-19 emergency treatment [ 1 ]. However there are\nlimitations and challenges with conventional COVID-19\ndiagnosis and treatment options. Therefore, great strides\ncontinue to be made in the development of effective pre-\nventative, diagnostic and therapeutic agents to combat\nCOVID-19.\n2  \u0007Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\nCoronavirus‑2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)\nThe SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises of open reading frames\n′ (ORFs) that encode various proteins [ 3 ]. At the 5 -terminal\nregion, non-structural proteins (NSPs) essential for virus\nreplication are encoded by ORF1 and ORF2, whereas the\n′ 3 -terminal region encodes functional structural proteins\n(spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], nucleocapsid [N]\nand 8 accessory proteins) [ 3 ]. The M, E and S proteins are\nlocated in the viral envelope, whereas the N protein is found\nin the core of the virus (Fig. 1 ) [ 2 ]. These proteins have spe-\ncific and vital roles that allow the virus to survive and thrive\nin host cells (Fig. 1 ) [ 2 ].\nThe ectoenzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n(ACE2) is situated on the cell plasma membrane in vari-\nous organ tissues but is widely distributed on epithelial\ncells of the respiratory tract [ 2 , 3 ]. The ACE2 receptor is\nutilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells [ 3 ]. The S\nprotein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and\nbinds with high affinity to the ACE2 receptor by forming a\ntransmembrane homotrimer [ 3 ]. It has two subunits, S1 and\nS2, that function in ACE2 binding and viral fusion to cell\nmembranes, respectively [ 3 ]. Additionally, S protein prim-\ning is required for entry into cells [ 10 ]. Cellular proteases\n(TMPRSS2 or cathepsin) prime the S protein by cleavage,\nwhich leads to viral and cellular membrane fusion [ 10 ]. The",

The accessible conformation\nhas at least one RBD in an up-state, whereas the inaccessible\nconformation has all the RBDs in a down-state. The S pro-\ntein oscillates between the active and inactive conformation\n[ 11 ]. Notably, the RBD in the accessible up-state is needed\nfor ACE2 to bind and allow cleavage by cellular proteases,\nresulting in a conformational change in S2 which allows\nviral entry [ 11 ]. Therefore, neutralizing agents may bind to\nthe RBD-up conformation, thus inhibiting infection, or bind\nto the RBD-down conformation, which ultimately prevents\nviral entry [ 12 ].\nAfter viral entry, SARS-CoV-2 proceeds to release its\ngenetic material, which is translated into viral replicase\npolyproteins (pp) [ 2 , 3 ]. These proteins are cleaved by viral\nproteinases, leading to the formation of functional NSPs\n(helicase [Hel] and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase\n[RdRp]) that are responsible for structural protein RNA rep-\nlication [ 3 ]. Notably, the S protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are\npromising drug targets [ 10 ].\nThe emergence of variants (Table 1 ) such as Alpha\n(B.1.1.7, UK), Beta (B.1.351, South Africa [SA]), Gamma\n(P.1, Brazil), Delta (B.1.617.2, India) and Omicron\n(B.1.1.529, Botswana/SA) [ 13 ] are of great concern [ 14 ,\n15 ]. Each of these variants lead to a new wave of infections\nand can potentially evade host immunity (developed post\ninfection or vaccination) as well as therapeutics [ 14 , 15 ].\nNotably, the Omicron variant has been shown to be more\ntransmissible, have an increased rate of infections, higher\nre-infection risk profile, greater immune escape capabilities\nand the largest number of mutations compared with the other\nSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and their mutations [ 4 , 6 , 18 , Table 1\nEmergence country and date SARS-CoV-2 variant Mutations\nUK B.1.1.7/Alpha\nSeptember 2020\nSouth Africa B.1.351/Beta\nMay 2020\nBrazil P.1/Gamma\nNovember 2020\nP314L, E1264D, S253P, E92\nIndia B.1.617.2/Delta\nOctober 2020\nSouth Africa B.1.1.529/Omicron\nNovember 2021\nN28del, A29del\nSARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2\n\n195\nvariants (Table 1 ) [ 6 , 13 , 15 ]. Notably, individuals infected\nwith the Delta and Beta variant have a 40% and 60% chance\nof re-infection with the Omicron variant, respectively [ 13 ].\nMutations in the S protein, such as E484K and N501Y, have\nbeen identified in the Brazil, SA, and UK variants (Table 1 )\n[ 16 ]. Mutations such as D614G, N501Y, and K417N allow\nthe virus to be more infectious, while the H655Y, N679K,\nand P681H mutations allow the virus to be more transmissi-\nble [ 6 ]. These mutations alter RBD epitopes, allow the virus\nto escape Ab neutralization, evade host immune responses,\nmay render treatments ineffective [ 4 ], and enhance receptor\nbinding specificity, virus growth [ 16 ], infectivity and viru-\nlence [ 17 ].\nNotably, SARS-CoV-2 strains have been associated with\ndevastating outbreaks, greatly increased infection rates and\ndecreased vaccine efficacy [ 4 ]. Additionally, the continuous\nemergence of new variants has the potential to cause waves\nof infection in populations that already achieved protective\nimmunity against previous strains [ 4 ]. Taken together, vari-\nants and associated mutations may negatively impact Ab\nand vaccine efficacy, which increases the number of Abs\nand vaccines required for protective and therapeutic pur-\nposes [ 16 ].\n3  \u0007Current Diagnosis Methods for COVID‑19\nAfter the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, diagnostic tests were rap-\nidly developed in order to detect the virus earlier rather than\nlater [ 3 ].

Notably, viral RNA load, which\ncan affect detection methods, is usually highest between 0\nand 4 days (89%) and then decreases between 10 and 14 days\n(54%) [ 20 ]. Unfortunately, sample collection can be uncom-\nfortable for the patient and sample processing is a lengthy\nprocedure requiring a laboratory facility. Additionally, both\nsample collection and processing require trained personal.\nSpecimens are evaluated using virus-specific serological and\nmolecular tests in order to provide a diagnosis [ 21 ]. Specific\nSARS-CoV-2 proteins are identified using enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigen tests, point-of-care\n(POC) blood test or Western blots (serological tests), while\nspecific SARS-CoV-2 genes are detected using quantitative\npolymerase chain reaction (qPCR), real-time PCR (RT-PCR)\nor northern blot hybridization (molecular tests) [ 7 , 20 – 22 ].\nInitially, positive cases were identified using RT-PCR; there-\nafter, ELISA kits and various other tests were developed [ 3 ].\nThe RT-PCR technique is an accurate assay regularly\nutilized for SARS-CoV-2 detection and diagnosis [ 8 , 22 ].\nCurrently, there are various COVID-19 RT-PCR kits com-\nmercially available that target various viral genes (RdRp, E,\nN, S, ORF1ab, ORF1a, and ORF1b or ORF8) for detection\n[ 8 , 20 , 23 ]. Notably, RT-PCR has been considered the gold\nstandard but there are advantages and challenges. RT-qPCR\nprovides reliability, flexibility, high sensitivity and specific-\nity, however the challenges include false negatives, a lengthy\nand complex procedure, requirement of expensive equipment\nand trained personnel, sample quantities for RNA isolation,\nsample integrity, low viral load samples, and delivery time\nof results to patients (> 24 h) [ 23 , 24 ]. Additionally, muta-\ntions in the target regions have the potential to effect RT-\nPCR accuracy, resulting in test failures and false-negatives\n[ 20 ]. However, researchers are developing specific primers\nto allow the detection of major variants [ 20 ].\nThe Omicron variant can affect RT-PCR test perfor-\nmance, e.g. the Thermo Fischer TaqPath assay attributable to\nthe 69–70 deletion [ 25 ], which can lead to the failure of cer-\ntain PCR assays [ 13 ]. This indicates the importance of tests\ntargeting more than one genomic region of SARS-CoV-2,\nas this may prevent test failures and false negative results\n[ 25 ]. Notably, PCR diagnostics can determine the SARS-\nCoV-2 cases that need sequencing to detect Omicron cases\n[ 13 ]. In the Alpha variant S gene, amino acids 69 and 70 are\ndeleted (Δ69–70), resulting in the absent/negative S-gene\n(S−), whereas the Delta variant does not contain the 69–70\ndeletion, resulting in a positive S-gene (S+) [ 13 ]. The Omi-\ncron variant S-gene also contains the 69–70 deletion [ 13 ].\nSince the Alpha variant cases have decreased considerably,\nthe S− results (suspect Omicron infection) could be used as\na marker, together with sequencing, for Omicron detection\n[ 13 , 25 ]. However, variants do have sub-lineages and the\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nOmicron BA.2 sub-lineage does not contain the 69–70 dele-\ntion, hence it is S+ [ 6 ]. Therefore, whole-genome sequenc-\ning with next-generation sequencing is required for confir-\nmation of the Omicron variant even though it is a lengthy\nand expensive process [ 6 , 26 ].\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has\nbeen considered a reliable alternative to conventional RT-\nPCR [ 20 ]. It is a fast and cheap method that is highly specific\ndue to the use of 6–8 specific primer sequences that detect\neight different regions [ 20 ]. Additionally, it can identify\nSARS-CoV-2 from swabs or saliva without the requirement\nof RNA isolation [ 23 ]. The RT-LAMP method is inexpen-\nsive, fast, and highly specific, however sensitivity is depend-\nent on viral load [ 24 ]. Notably, proper primer design and use\nof specific primers are essential to maximize sensitivity [ 23 ].\nThe ELISA method is a cost-effective quantitative, quali-\ntative, highly specific, sensitive, efficient and simple pro-\ncedure [ 23 ]. ELISAs are reliable, commercially available\nkits that mostly detect the S and N proteins [ 20 ]. However,\nthe ELISA success rate is greatly dependent on the stage of\nCOVID-19 and the viral load [ 20 ]. Additionally, ELISAs\ncan detect Abs produced against a specific viral antigen (S\nand N proteins) [ 20 ]. Several kits measure the ratio between\nimmunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG [ 20 ]. ELISA sensitivity\nand specificity were shown to be 85.7–80% and 98.5–100%,\nrespectively [ 24 ]. ELISAs are able to detect recent or pre-\nvious SARS-CoV-2 exposure, however challenges include\nsample quantity, sample integrity and lengthy assay proce-\ndure, and results are dependent on a patient’s immunity (IgG\nand IgM) and delivery time of the results (> 24 h) [ 24 ].\nLateral flow assays (LFAs) identify SARS-CoV-2 anti-\ngens (N) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs (IgG and IgM) [ 24 ]. It\nis a simple, qualitative test that does not require specialized/\nexpensive laboratory equipment [ 24 ]. LFAs are used as POC\ntesting and are small in size, fast, sensitive (90%), specific\n(98%), stable, and low in cost [ 23 ]. However, LFAs can pro-\nduce false-negative results due to low viral load samples\n[ 24 ]. Mistry et al. reviewed the literature on LFAs in order\nto assess sensitivity and specificity [ 27 ]. The percentage sen-\nsitivity of assays showed a wide range of 37–99%, whereas\nspecificity was 92–100% [ 27 ]. The CORIS and BIOSEN-\nSOR assays were the lowest in sensitivity (45%), whereas\nthe most evaluated Panbio Abbott assay had a sensitivity\nof 78.41% [ 27 ]. The specificity of all assays was > 93%\n[ 27 ]. Notably, the BD Veritor, BIOCREDIT, COVID-VIRO\nassays showed 100% specificity [ 27 ].\nAntigen-detecting diagnostic tests allow for rapid and\ninexpensive delivery of results [ 28 ]. Commercially avail-\nable tests include the Panbio (Abbott), Standard Q (SD\nBiosensor/Roche), Sure Status (Premier Medical Corpora-\ntion), 2019-nCoV (Wondfo), Beijng Tigsun Diagnostics Co.\nLtd. (Tigsun), Onsite (CTK Biotech), Acon Biotech (Flow-\nflex), and the NowCheck Covid-19 Ag test (Bionote) [ 28 ].",

Bekliz et al. investigated\nthe sensitivity of these eight tests against the variants [ 28 ].\nCompared with other variants, these tests showed a general\nlower sensitivity to Omicron BA.1 in cultured virus and in\ninfectious virus analysis [ 28 ]. Notably, the Acon test dem-\nonstrated the most sensitivity for Omicron-BA.1 and most\nother variants [ 28 ].\nHardick et al. compared the sensitivity of POC antigen\nassays (BD Veritor, Abbott BinaxNow, Orasure InteliSwab\nand Quidel QuickVue) in detecting the Omicron and Delta\nvariants [ 29 ]. Results showed that the assays with the highest\nsensitivity for the Omicron variant were Abbott BinaxNow\nand Orasure InteliSwab, whereas those with the highest\nsensitivity for the Delta variant were Orasure InteliSwab\nand Quidel QuickVue [ 29 ]. Notably, only the QuickVue\nassay detected all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive nasal/\nnasopharyngeal swab samples [ 29 ]. The Omicron variant\nwas identified by these rapid antigen tests, however there is\nstill a decreased sensitivity of antigen tests compared with\nmolecular tests [ 29 ]. At high virus levels, the BinaxNOW\ntest (Abbott) was shown to identify infections with vari-\nants, including the Omicron variant [ 30 ]. However, at low\nvirus levels (early stage of infection), the BinaxNOW test\nmay indicate a negative result, thus a confirmatory RT-PCR\nshould be conducted [ 30 ].\nAntigen detection tests that target the N antigen can pre-\nvent test invalidation due to changes in the S protein [ 25 ].\nHowever, the Omicron variant has some mutations in its\nN sequence which may negatively impact the N antigen\ndetection tests [ 25 ]. In comparison with PCR tests, some\nstudies have indicated that about half of the positive cases\nidentified by rapid tests are false positives [ 6 ]. Generally,\nantigen tests have been less sensitive than RT-PCR tests,\ntherefore negative antigen test results should be verified by\nan RT-PCR test, especially for a possible Omicron infection\n[ 6 , 25 ]. There are also mutation-specific tests (E484K/Q,\nL452R, N501Y) that identify mutations that can be linked\nto the variants [ 25 ].\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\n(CRISPR) have the potential to provide rapid, accurate and\nportable diagnostic assays [ 20 , 31 ]. The principle of the\ntechnology is that CRISPR RNA (crRNA) can bind to spe-\ncific target sequences and activate CRISPR and CRISPR-\nassociated (Cas) enzymes such as Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13\n[ 23 , 31 ]. This has been referred to as next-generation diag-\nnostics, and CRISPR-Cas technology has been utilized in\nthe development of tools to identify SARS-CoV-2 infec-\ntion [ 31 ]. Liang et al. (2021) developed and validated a\nCRISPR-Cas12a-based multiplex allele-specific assay for\nSARS-CoV-2 variant identification that is highly sensi-\ntive and specific [ 31 ]. The assay is capable of identifying\n\n197\nsingle nucleotide mutations and recognizing variants (Alpha,\nBeta and Delta) based on a combination of various crRNAs\nthat are specific for vital SARS-CoV-2 mutations (K417N,\nL452R/Q, T478K, E484K/Q, and N501Y) [ 31 ]. Notably, it\nrequires a comprehensive interpretation of multiple results\ndue to no single mutation, or one crRNA could distinguish\nbetween all variants [ 31 ]. Thereafter, Liang et al. investi-\ngated the use of the CRISPR-Cas12a assay for detection of\nthe omicron variant [ 32 ], and the results indicated that one\ncrRNA containing 3–4 mutations was able to identify and\ndiagnose the variant [ 32 ]. Finally, the CRISPR-Cas12a assay\nwas shown to detect major variants of concern (Alpha, Beta,\nDelta, and Omicron) in clinical samples [ 33 ]. Wang et al.\ndescribed the detection method, light-up CRISPR-Cas13\ntranscription amplification, which can target and identify\nSARS-CoV-2 as well as mutated variants [ 34 ]. The ligation\nprocess and Cas13a/crRNA recognition ensures sequence\nspecificity (detects mutations), while the light-up RNA\naptamer leads to the sensitive output of signals [ 34 ]. This\nassay may be useful in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in swabs and\nfood packages [ 34 ]. The CRISPR method is fast and simple\nand expensive equipment is not needed, however virus muta-\ntions can cause false results [ 24 ].\nDiagnostic and treatment interventions should target con-\nserved areas due to the development of mutations in cer-\ntain areas [ 26 ]. Therefore, the current research is focused\non developing SARS-CoV-2 detection assays that are cost\neffective, have easy sample collection (e.g. saliva or finger\nprick), are user friendly (conducted by the patient), and have\nrapid indication of results (15–30 min).\n4  \u0007Current Treatments for COVID‑19\nThe pandemic lead to an urgent need for treatments to com-\nbat the disease and save lives. Treatments that disrupt the\nlifecycle may decrease viral replication and spread, whereas\ntreatments that target host receptor proteins can decease/\nblock virus attachment and entry [ 35 ]. Various treatment\noptions have been proposed for SARS-CoV-2, such as repur-\nposing of antiviral treatments, passive immunotherapy, vac-\ncines and Abs. Although these options have been beneficial\nto a certain extent, there have been various limitations and\nchallenges observed with their use.\n4.1  \u0007Antiviral Treatments\nRepurposed antiviral treatments have been investigated for\ntheir possible use and are under investigation in randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) [ 3 ]. The drugs included lopinavir\n(LPV), ribavirin, favipiravir (FPV), remdesivir, chloroquine,\nmolnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, and paxlovid.",

Furthermore, the LPV and\nritonavir (RTV; inhibits LPV metabolism) combination\ntreatment has been used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV\n[ 3 ]. However, in severely SARS-CoV-2 infected individu-\nals, the LPV/RTV treatment demonstrated no benefit [ 3 ,\n37 ]. Şimşek-Yavuz et al. reviewed and analyzed data from\nrandomized clinical trials and concluded LPV/RTV was\nineffective and should not be utilized [ 38 ]. Moreover, a sys-\ntematic review of RCTs reported that in COVID-19 patients,\nLPV/RTV utilization did not provide any significant clinical\nimprovement and adverse reactions were notable [ 39 ].\nThe guanosine nucleoside analog ribavirin depletes\nintracellular guanosine, increases interferon (IFN) gene\nexpression, and targets viral RdRp [ 3 , 36 ]. In a MERS-CoV\nstudy, ribavirin and IFNα-2b treatment was promising [ 36 ].\nHowever in respiratory patients, ribavirin decreases hemo-\nglobin concentrations, which decreases its antiviral poten-\ntial against SARS-CoV-2 [ 36 ]. FPV is also a guanosine\nanalog that targets RdRP [ 36 ]. In COVID-19 patients, FPV\nimproved fever and cough but did not improve the recovery\nrate [ 40 ]. Qomara et al. reviewed RCTs of antiviral drugs\nand the results indicated that the clinical status of patients\nwas improved following FPV treatment, but there was no\nsignificant change in clinical recovery [ 39 ].\nRemdesivir (an adenosine nucleotide analog) has shown\nantiviral activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [ 3 , 36 ].\nIt inhibits RdRp, integrates into viral RNA, and decreases viral\nRNA production [ 20 , 36 ]. Remdesivir has also been shown\nto inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation ( in vitro ) [ 36 , 41 ]. The\nFDA approved remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment in adult,\npediatric and old-age patients [ 6 ]. In a COVID-19 clinical\ntrial, remdesivir treatment demonstrated clinical improvement\n(68%) in individuals [ 42 ], but it should not be used in patients\nreceiving invasive ventilation due to increased mortality rates\nnoted [ 42 ]. A review of RCTs revealed that the potential ben-\nefits of remdesivir treatment in hospitalized patients included\nfaster recovery time, decreased length of hospitalization, and\nrespiratory adverse effects, but its effect on decreasing mortality\nwas unclear [ 39 ].\nChloroquine increases endosomal pH, interferes with M\nprotein proteolytic processing, alters virion assembly, and\ninterferes with ACE2 receptor and S protein glycosylation, ulti-\nmately blocking viral infection [ 3 , 36 ]. It was shown to inhibit\nSARS-CoV-2 in vitro [ 36 ]. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, an\nincrease in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels was noted [ 3 ].\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine derivative)\nhave demonstrated immunomodulatory effects as well as the\ncapability of suppressing IL-6 and IL-10 immune responses\n[ 3 ]. The adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine\ntreatment may be severe, e.g. cardiac arrhythmia [ 43 ]. Notably,\na chloroquine overdose is toxic and fatal [ 36 ]. Initially, clinical\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nstudies demonstrated the potential of chloroquine/hydroxychlo-\nroquine as an effective COVID-19 treatment [ 44 ], and more\nrecently, Axfors et al. estimated the effects of hydroxychloro-\nquine and chloroquine by reviewing and analyzing data from\nRCTs [ 43 ]. Their results concluded that chloroquine treatment\nproduced no benefit, whereas hydroxychloroquine treatment\nwas associated with increased COVID-19 patient mortality\n[ 43 ]. Additionally, Şimşek-Yavuz et al. concluded that hydrox-\nychloroquine was ineffective and should not be utilized [ 38 ].\nMolnupiravir targets viral RNA polymerase and integrates\ninto SARS-CoV-2 genetic information, leading to a change in\nthe virus [ 6 ] and ultimately inhibiting/preventing further repli-\ncation [ 45 ]. The FDA approved molnupiravir for emergency use\nfor COVID-19. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir have been shown\nto inhibit viral polymerase and protease (e.g. 3CL protease) [ 6 ],\nresulting in a decrease in disease progression [ 45 ]. Utilization\nof a molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir combination has a great anti-\nviral effect [ 26 ] and has demonstrated efficacy against Omicron\ninfection [ 26 , 46 ].\nPaxlovid interferes with the SARS-CoV-2 processing pro-\nteins, which prevents transmission [ 26 , 46 ], and has shown\npotential against COVID-19 [ 26 ]. The FDA approved paxlovid\n(nirmatrelvir tablets and RTV tablets) for emergency use in\nCOVID-19 patients experiencing mild to moderate symptoms\nand who were at high risk of developing severe illness [ 6 ].\nNotably, molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir, remdesivir, and pax-\nlovid have demonstrated neutralizing activity against vari-\nants, including Omicron [ 6 , 45 ]. Lai et al. reviewed and\nanalyzed data from RCTs to determine the clinical efficacy\nand safety of antiviral drugs for non-hospitalized COVID-\n19 patients [ 47 ]. Their results indicated that antiviral drugs\nwere related to a significantly lower risk of hospitalization/\ndeath [ 47 ]. Additionally, nirmatrelvir plus RTV was the best\nantiviral treatment with the lowest hospitalization/death risk,\nfollowed by remdesivir and molnupiravir [ 47 ].\nAntiviral therapy that rapidly decreases viral load may\nimprove patient outcomes and limit virus transmission [ 26 ].\nAntiviral drugs have been approved and have shown some\npotential against COVID-19, however some may have lower\nSARS-CoV-2 specificity especially due to mutations/vari-\nants [ 48 ]. In COVID-19 patients, antiviral drugs have been\nprescribed and accepted but further research is needed to\ndetermine and understand the potential negative effects [ 26 ].\nThus, the continual development of therapeutics is essential.\n4.2  \u0007Vaccines\nVaccines are a preventative option [ 7 ] and SARS-CoV-2\nvaccine categories include mRNA, adenoviral vector, and\ninactivated and recombinant subunit vaccines [ 49 ].

The rAd26-S and rAd5-S adenovi-\nral vector vaccines are well tolerated, induce strong immune\nresponses, and stimulated similar concentrations of neutraliz-\ning Abs as recovered COVID-19 patients [ 50 ]. Jackson et al.\nrevealed that the mRNA-1273 vaccine stimulated immune\nresponses against SARS-CoV-2 [ 51 ]. Notably, the Pfizer vac-\ncine successfully prevented COVID-19 by approximately 90%\n[ 7 ], and its efficacy against hospitalization was about 93% [ 45 ].\nHowever, there have been recurring SARS-CoV-2 infec-\ntions, which suggests that certain individuals do not develop\na highly protective immune response and do not sufficiently\nrespond to vaccinations [ 4 ]. Additionally, studies have shown\nthat 6 months after vaccination, the level of serum neutralizing\nAbs greatly decreased [ 15 ]. To make matters worse, several\nhighly virulent and transmissible strains have been identified,\nwhich affects the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments\n[ 4 ]. Notably, in individuals who have recovered from a COVID-\n19 infection or received an mRNA vaccine (two doses), the\npoly-mutant S was mostly fully resistant to neutralizing Abs\n[ 13 ].\nPreviously, most vaccines have shown effectiveness against\nthe Alpha variant, however vaccine efficacy was considerably\nreduced against the Beta variant and further reduced against the\nGamma variant [ 49 ]. For example, in individuals who received\nthe CoronaVac vaccine, the neutralizing Abs against the vari-\nants were decreased by 2.9- 12.5-fold (Alpha, 2.9-fold; Beta,\nGamma, Delta, and Omicron, 12.5-fold) [ 52 ]. The BNT162b2\nvaccine-induced Ab titers decreased by 4- to 6-fold for Delta\ncompared with the Alpha variant [ 53 ]. The efficacy of the\nAZD1222 and BNT162b2 complete vaccinations was 67–88 %\nagainst the Delta variant compared with 74–94% for the Alpha\nvariant [ 53 ].\nThe Omicron variant showed a greater resistance against\nvaccine-induced immunity [ 53 ]. In SA, vaccine efficacy\nagainst infection decreased by the Delta and Omicron variants\nby 80% and 33%, respectively [ 13 ]. Furthermore, vaccine-\ninduced (mRNA-1273, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Ad26.COV2.S,\nBNT162b2, AZD1222) neutralizing Ab titers against the Omi-\ncron variant significantly decreased [ 53 ]. For instance, Ab titers\ninduced by BNT162b2 and AZD1222 against Omicron were\n36- to 44-fold lower ( in vitro ) [ 53 ]. In comparison with the\noriginal strain, both the mRNA1273 and AstraZeneca complete\nvaccinations showed a decrease in neutralizing Abs against the\nOmicron variant by 74-fold and 14- to 21-fold, respectively\n\n199\n[ 45 ]. Although, COVID-19 vaccines based on wild-type dem-\nonstrated reduced efficacy against the variants, they are still\neffective against the development of severe disease, hospitaliza-\ntion, and death [ 13 , 15 ]. For example, the efficacy of the Pfizer-\nBioNTech vaccine is decreased by the Omicron variant but still\ndecreases the risk of hospitalization (70%) [ 13 ].\nDue to the continuous emergence of several SARS-CoV-2\nvariants, there is a requirement for booster vaccines or new\nvaccines that are tailored against various strains. Previous stud-\nies have demonstrated that heterologous boosters have greater\nneutralization efficacy against variants than the homologous\nvaccines [ 26 , 49 , 53 ]. Notably, a booster vaccination is able to\nrestore Ab levels, enhance vaccine efficacy and provide pro-\ntection against variants, including Omicron [ 13 , 15 , 54 ]. In\npolyclonal sera from BNT162b2 (two doses) vaccinated and\nrecovered individuals, there was a lack of neutralizing activity\nagainst the Omicron variant as well as resistance to monoclonal\nAbs (mAbs) [ 55 ]. Notably, mRNA booster immunizations led\nto a marked increase in neutralizing activity against the Omi-\ncron variant in these individuals [ 55 ]. An mRNA booster vac-\ncine was shown to induce strong variant cross-neutralization\n[ 45 ]. In comparison with the Wuhan strain, post mRNA vac-\ncine BNT162b2 (two doses) showed a > 22-fold decrease in\nOmicron-neutralizing Ab titers; however, after a booster dose,\nthe levels were increased 23-fold [ 56 ]. In individuals vaccinated\nwith adenovirus or inactivated vaccines, an mRNA vaccine\nbooster can induce elevated levels of neutralizing Abs against\nthe Omicron variant [ 49 ].\nPreviously, a vaccine targeting the mutant S demonstrated\nthat the level of neutralizing Abs against mutant viruses\nwas high, but Ab levels against wild-type were lower [ 15 ,\n57 ]. Although booster vaccines increase neutralizing activ-\nity against the Omicron variant, the neutralizing activity is\nstill lower than the neutralizing activity against the original\nstrain [ 45 ]. Polyvalent vaccines elicit Abs against diverse\nepitopes and are therefore able to be effective against several\nvariants [ 26 ]. Taken together, continuous research is vital to\ndevelop bivalent vaccines (targeting wild-type and variants)\nand variant-specific vaccines (against the Omicron variant)\n[ 15 , 57 ].\n4.3  \u0007Passive Immunotherapy and Antibodies\nTherapeutic options for COVID-19 may include passive Ab\ntherapy that can reduce virus replication and disease sever-\nity [ 35 ].

The FDA authorized high-titer CP treatment for\nemergency use in hospitalized patients with compromised\nhumoral immunity and/or early-stage disease [ 9 ]. Data from\n16 RCTs indicated that in non-severe patients, CP has no\nbenefit [ 58 ]; therefore, WHO recommended against CP uti-\nlizations in non-severe patients, but it can be used for critical\npatients within clinical trials [ 58 ].\nSeveral Abs (e.g. B38, H4, CB6 and 4A8) have been iso-\nlated from convalescent COVID-19 individuals. The B38\nand H4 Abs blocked RBD-ACE2 binding and decreased\nvirus titers in infected lungs ( in vivo ) [ 59 ]. The CB6 Ab\ninterferes with the virus-receptor interaction and neutralizes\nSARS-CoV-2 in vitro [ 60 ]. On the other hand, the 4A8 mAb\ndoes not block the S–ACE2 interaction, but showed high\nneutralization potency against the authentic and pseudotyped\nvirus in vitro [ 61 ].\nMemory B-cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 can be iso-\nlated from convalescent COVID-19 individuals and used to\nidentify/clone mAbs [ 62 ]. Cloned mAbs bind specifically\nto RBD, block the RBD–ACE2 interaction, and neutralize\npseudotyped virus infection [ 62 ]. Three RBD-specific mAbs\n(P2C-1F11, P2B-2F6 and P2C-1A3) demonstrated potent\nneutralization of live virus [ 63 ]. Pinto et al. described mAbs,\nsuch as S309, that target SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein [ 64 ].\nThe S309 mAb demonstrated potent authentic and pseu-\ndovirus neutralization [ 64 ]. Notably, the neutralization was\nenhanced by Ab cocktails that contain S309 [ 64 ].\nIn comparison with the original strain, the neutralization\npotency of CP against variants is significantly decreased\n[ 45 ].\nThe Omicron variant successfully escapes Abs that were\ninduced by infection with previous variants, which indicates\nthat CP may not be effective [ 26 ]. Ma et al. revealed that in\ncomparison with the wild-type strain with D614G mutation,\nthe 1-year post-infection CP demonstrated a reduction in\nneutralization activity against the Omicron (10.15-fold) and\nDelta (1.79-fold) variants [ 65 ]. Notably, there was a much\ngreater decrease in neutralization activity against the Omi-\ncron variant [ 65 ] .\nPreviously, Ab phage-display libraries from recovered\nCOVID-19 patients were used to isolate Abs that have\nshown potent neutralization of certain variants (picomo-\nlar doses) [ 66 ]. The NE12 Ab neutralizes the Alpha and\nDelta variants, while the NA8 Ab neutralizes the Beta and\nOmicron variants [ 66 ]. Additionally, in a golden Syrian\nhamster model, the NE12 and NA8 Abs demonstrated pre-\nventative and therapeutic efficacy [ 66 ].\nHowever, there are many challenges with the use of CP\ntreatment that require further evaluation [ 35 ]. Challenges\ninclude insufficient donor availability, health condition\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nof donors, viral kinetics, variability between different\nbatches of plasma, and host interactions of SARS-CoV-2\n[ 35 ]. Notably, the variability between one batch of CP and\nanother batch leads to several levels of success (low–high),\nwhich limits treatment reliability [ 9 ].\nAntibodies such as mAbs, functional antigen-binding\nfragment (Fab), and single-chain variable region fragment\n(scFv) can be used to prevent and treat infections [ 67 ].\nThese scientifically generated Abs can be developed to\ntarget S1-RBD, S1 N-terminal domain (NTD), and the S2\nregion [ 67 ]. Therefore, viral infection can be inhibited by\nAbs blocking RBD-receptor binding as well as impeding\nS2-mediated membrane fusion and viral entry [ 67 ].\nPreviously, Abs have been developed against SARS-\nCoV-1 and MERS-CoV [ 67 ]. In vitro and in vivo , SARS-\nCoV-1 Abs demonstrated strong neutralizing activity, but\nthese Abs have not been evaluated in clinical studies [ 67 ].\nSimilarly, the majority of the MERS-CoV Abs still need\nto be evaluated in clinical studies [ 67 ].\nNotably, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have a ± 79%\nsimilarity and a high S protein sequence identity [ 2 , 67 ].\nTherefore, scientists have investigated the potential cross-\nreactivity and cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-1\nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 35 , 67 ]. Both m396\nand CR3014 are potent SARS-CoV-1-specific Abs that tar-\nget the ACE2 binding site [ 68 ], but these Abs do not bind\nto the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [ 68 ]. On the other hand, the\nSARS-CoV-1 Ab CR3022 does bind to the SARS-CoV-2\nS protein with high affinity [ 68 ].\nWang et al. produced a human 47D11 mAb and showed\nthat it  strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped\nvesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection and neutralizes\nauthentic infection in vitro [ 69 ]. Thereafter, a clinical trial\ndemonstrated that an mAb cocktail significantly decreased\nhospitalization and deaths associated with COVID-19 [ 9 ].\nSubsequently, the FDA authorized three mAb cocktails for\nemergency use in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2\nand at high risk for developing detrimental COVID-19 [ 9 ].\nSeveral mAbs have shown to be effective in the treat-\nment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including bamlanivimab,\nregdanvimab, etesevimab, cilgavimab, tixagevimab,\ncasirivimab, and imdevimab [ 26 ]. Most mAbs target/\ninhibit the S protein RBD [ 6 ], and variants, especially the\nOmicron variant, [ 18 ] have several S protein mutations\n[ 26 ]. These alterations change the binding of Abs to vari-\nants, which may affect their neutralization capabilities and\nallow variants to resist mAb neutralization [ 26 ].\nThe FDA has approved certain mAbs for emergency uti-\nlization to treat COVID-19 patients who may progress to\nsevere disease [ 6 ]. These mAbs include bamlanivimab plus\netesevimab, casirivimab plus imdevimab (REGEN-COV ),\nTM\nsotrovimab, and tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld)\n[ 6 ].",

In a phase III trial, REGEN-\nTM COV treatment led to a 70% decrease in hospitalization/\ndeath of COVID-19 patients [ 20 ]. In adults and pediatric\nTM COVID-19 patients, REGEN-COV is FDA approved for\nthe treatment of mild to moderate disease that has a high risk\nTM of developing into severe disease [ 20 ]. REGEN-COV , and\nbamlanivimab + etesevimab treatments demonstrated effi-\ncacy against previous variants of concern, but decreased or\nno neutralization activity against the Omicron variant [ 45 ].\nPreviously, the bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) and etese-\nvimab (LY-CoV016) Ab cocktail was approved for emer-\ngency use [ 15 ]. Mutations at the S protein positions 484 and\n417 have been related to immune evasion [ 15 ]. The Beta\nand Gamma variants were shown to escape neutralization by\nbamlanivimab due to the E484K mutation and etesevimab\ndue to the K417N/T [ 70 ] mutation. The E484A and K417N\nmutations are also present in the Omicron variant, thus it\nmay also be resistant to these Abs [ 15 ].\nHigh-potency medications are required that target several\nSARS-CoV-2 variants [ 26 ]. Previously, mAb neutralization\nactivity against variants was assessed by a live-virus focus\nreduction neutralization assay (FRNT) [ 71 ]. The Omicron\nvariant was not neutralized by etesevimab, bamlanivimab\nand imdevimab [ 71 ], while casirivimab demonstrated a\nmuch lower level of Omicron variant neutralization com-\npared with other variants [ 71 ]. The tixagevimab (COV2-\n2196), cilgavimab (COV2-2130), and sotrovimab (S309)\nAbs showed neutralization activity against the Beta, Gamma\nand Omicron variant [ 71 ]; however, activity against the\nOmicron variant was at a much higher concentration [ 71 ].\nCilgavimab and tixagevimab showed a 43-fold decrease in\nneutralizing potency against the Omicron variant [ 45 ].\nThe binding of sotrovimab (S309) or Evusheld were not\ninfluenced by the Omicron variant mutations [ 26 ]. Further-\nmore, sotrovimab has demonstrated effectiveness against\nLimitations and chal- Fig. 2\nlenges with the utilization of\nconventional antibodies\n\n201\nthe Omicron variant ( in vitro ) [ 26 ]. The neutralization\nactivity of certain mAbs is based on targeting regions out-\nside of the RBD or conserved epitopes, which allows the\nmaintenance of effectiveness against several variants [ 26 ],\ne.g. sotrovimab, S2X259, and S2H97 targeting conserved\nepitopes and neutralizing the Omicron variant [ 26 ]. Notably,\nthe authorized mAb treatments for Omicron are sotrovimab\nand Evusheld [ 6 ].\nMost mAbs target the RBD, which can have various\nmutations depending on the SARS-CoV-2 variant [ 25 ]. The\nOmicron variant has several S RBD mutations, which indi-\ncates its potential to escape mAb neutralization [ 15 ]. Muta-\ntions allow the variants, especially Omicron, to resist mAb\nneutralization, thus decreasing mAb efficacy [ 25 ]. Notably,\nutilizing mAbs overcomes the challenges with serum therapy\ndue to mAb specificity, purity, and safety [ 35 ].\nAlthough Abs may be beneficial, some limitations and\nchallenges are experienced with the use of Abs (large size,\nfragile, elevated immunogenicity) (Fig. 2 ) [ 72 ].\nmAb treatments can be useful for patients experienc-\ning mild COVID-19 symptoms [ 16 ]. However, due to\nthe small amount of Ab reaching the target area, large\nrepetitive Ab doses and intravenous administration by\nhealthcare professionals are needed for effective [ 5 ] pre-\nventative/therapeutic effects [ 16 ]. This may indicate the\nlow efficiency of intravenous Ab delivery because these\nlarge Abs will need to move through the plasma–lung\nbarrier in order to treat lung infections [ 5 ]. Addition-\nally, Abs usually only target one epitope at a time [ 16 ].\nThe modification and production of an Ab to contain\nvarious specificities is a slow and strenuous process that\naffects yield and quality [ 12 ]. Somatic mutations and\nAb-dependent enhancement (ADE) are also challenges\nthat may decrease Ab efficacy [ 7 ]. The emergence of\nnumerous SARS-CoV-2 mutations is a big challenge for\ndeveloping therapeutics [ 4 ]. Escape mutants can evade Ab",

Notably,\nnumerous anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs are ineffective against\nthe Beta and Gamma variants [ 4 ].\nResearchers are actively developing specific preventive\nand therapeutic strategies (vaccines, mAbs, IFN thera-\npies) for COVID-19 [ 35 ]. Currently, some SARS-CoV-\n2-specific Abs are still under development [ 67 ]. Unfor-\ntunately, the development, evaluation ( in vitro testing\n[neutralizing activity], in vivo testing [protective effec-\ntiveness], preclinical studies and clinical trials [safety and\nefficacy]) and approval of Abs for clinical application is a\nlengthy process (months or years) [ 35 , 67 ]. Moreover, in\nprevious animal models, clinical mAbs have been shown\nto be less efficient as a treatment than a prevention for\nCOVID-19 [ 5 ].\nAlthough mAbs can be beneficial, the various chal-\nlenges, especially their large-scale, labor-intensive,\nlengthy and expensive production, overshadows their\npotential clinical application and limits global accessi-\nbility [ 5 , 35 ]. Therefore novel therapies are required for\ndiseases such as COVID-19 to decrease virus replication,\nvirus spread, disease severity and fatality rates [ 35 ].\n5  \u0007Nanobodies\nNanobodies (VHH or Nbs) are small monomeric antigen-\nbinding fragments generated from heavy chain-only Abs that\nare present in camelids [ 72 ]. There are several advantages\nof Nbs, for example low toxicity, high affinity, sensitivity,\nwater solubility, effortless production, prolonged shelf life,\nand many more (Fig. 3 ) [ 72 ].\nAdvantages of Fig. 3\nnanobodies\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nNbs can be successfully selected from different types of\nlibraries (immune, naïve and synthetic) through several types\nof display technologies (phage, ribosome and yeast surface),\nand expressed in various expression systems (prokaryotic,\neukaryotic and plants) [ 7 ]. Engineering multivalent, bipara-\ntopic and bispecific Nbs with greater efficiency is straight-\nforward [ 12 , 72 ]. Mature Nbs and multivalent Nbs can\nachieve substantial neutralization potency that is equivalent\nto, or greater than (per mass), certain effective SARS-CoV-2\nmAbs [ 5 ]. Notably, the selection and large-scale production\nof specific Nbs can be achieved rapidly and inexpensively,\nwhich allows for high availability [ 72 ].\nNbs can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly,\nor subcutaneously, but inhalation delivery of Nb therapeutics\nis the most attractive option for COVID-19 [ 16 ]. In clini-\ncal specimens, SARS-CoV-2 viral copies was highest in the\nrespiratory system, whereas levels in blood were low [ 73 ].\nMoreover, systemic administration of mAbs results in low\nlevels (0.2%) of the mAb dose reaching the lung [ 74 ]. This\nindicates that therapeutic agents delivered though inhalation\nwould be more favorable than systemic administration [ 74 ].\nIn order for a treatment to be administered through pulmo-\nnary delivery, the treatment (e.g. Abs or Nbs) needs to be\nstable and to maintain structural integrity and bioactivity\n[ 74 ]. Notably, the various advantageous properties of Nbs\n(Fig. 3 ) can allow for successful Nb aerosolization [ 72 ] and\nNbs may be formulated (nebulized spray) to be administered\nthrough inhalation for pulmonary delivery [ 7 , 75 ].

By surface plasmon resonance (SPR),\nRBD binding of H11-H4 had a K of 5 nM and H11-D4 had\nD\na K of 10 nM, whereas by isothermal titration calorimetry\nD\n(ITC), RBD binding of H11-H4 had a K of 12 nM and H11-\nD\nD4 had a K of 39 nM. Furthermore, Nbs can be fused to\nD\nhuman IgG Fc domains [ 85 ]. The RBD binding was blocked\nby H11-H4-Fc ­(IC = 61 nM), H11-D4-Fc ­(IC = 161 nM)\n50 50\nand VHH72-Fc ­(IC = 262 nM) in vitro . In addition, ACE2\n50\nbinding was blocked by H11-H4-Fc ­(IC = 34 nM), H11-\n50\nD4-Fc ­(IC = 28 nM) and VHH72-Fc ­(IC = 33 nM) in\n50 50\nvitro . They were also shown to neutralize live virus, but\nH11-H4-Fc potency was greater [ 84 ]. The 50% neutralizing\ndose ­(ND ) of the virus was 6 nM for H11-H4-Fc and 18 nM\n50\nfor H11-D4-Fc. CR3022 Ab and H11-H4 Nb recognize dif-\nferent epitopes on the RBD, and a combination of these two\nagents have shown additive virus neutralization [ 84 ].\nThe Ty1 Nb demonstrated specific and high-affinity RBD\nbinding ( K 5–10 nM), neutralization of pseudotyped viruses\nD\n(Ty1: ­IC = 0.77 µg/mL; Ty1-Fc: ­IC of ~ 12 ng/mL), bind-\n50 50\ning to RBD in the ‘active’ and ‘inactive’ states as well as",

For detec-\ntion and diagnostic purposes, Ty1 can be utilized in flow\ncytometry and immunofluorescence [ 86 ]. For therapeutic\npurposes, large quantities of Ty1 can be produced fast and\nat a low cost [ 86 ].\nDong et al. produced multiple Nbs (e.g. 3F, 1B, 2A) that\nblock the SARS-CoV-2–ACE2 interaction, and a combina-\ntion of two Nbs showed synergistic blockage [ 85 ]. In order\nto improve S protein binding affinity, avidity, and block-\nage of the interaction, multiple different high-affinity Nbs\nthat target different but adjacent RBD epitopes can be\nfused into a multispecific Nb [ 85 ]. Notably, at therapeuti-\ncally relevant concentrations, S protein binding and block-\nade of the S–ACE2 interaction was significantly enhanced\nby the bi-specific Nb-fc ( K = 0.25 nM, ­IC 36.7 nM, ∼\nD 100\n­IC 12.2 nM, ­IC 1 nM) compared with the monoclo- ∼ ∼\n95 50\nnal Nb-Fc [ 85 ]. The bi-specific 1B-3F Nb-Fc demonstrated\nincreased binding to S1 RBD and S–ACE2 blockade [ 87 ].\n3F-Fc and 2A-Fc likely bind to different S1 RBD epitopes,\nwhereas 1B-Fc and 2A-Fc may bind to the same S1 RBD\n[ 87 ] epitope. 3F-Fc does not compete with 1B-Fc or 2A-Fc,\nand likely binds to a different epitope [ 87 ]. Thereafter, sev-\neral tri-specific Nb-Fc were constructed that demonstrated\na further enhancement in efficacy [ 87 ]. The tri-specific\nNb-Fc, 3F-1B-2A, showed extremely strong binding of\nS1 RBD, blockage of the S–ACE2 interaction and inhi-\nbition of pseudovirus infection in vitro [ 87 ]. In vitro , tri-\n~ 0.047 nM] and 1B-3F-2A specific Nbs (3F-1B-2A [ K\nD\n[ K ~ 0.095 nM]) demonstrated higher binding affinities\nD\nto S1 RBD than 1B-3F [ 87 ]. Additionally, tri-specific Nbs\n(3F-1B-2A [0.71 nM], 1B-3F-2A [0.74 nM], and full inhibi-\ntion [10 nM]) blocked the S–ACE2 interaction to a greater\nextent than mono-specific Nb-Fcs in combination ­(IC =\n50\n2.21 nM, and full inhibition around 100 nM) [ 87 ]. Similarly,\nthe tri-specific Nb-Fcs (3F-1B-2A, ­IC = 3.00 nM; and\n50\n1B-3F-2A, ­IC = 6.44 nM) neutralized pseudovirus infec-\n50\ntion more effectively than the combination of VHH-Fcs (1B,\n3F and 2A, ­IC = 29.19 nM) [ 87 ].\n50\nThree sybody (Sb) libraries (concave, loop and convex)\nwere used to rapidly select various Sbs against SARS-\nCoV-2 RBD [ 88 ]. The potent Sb23 showed high RBD bind-\ning affinity ( K = 10 nM) and effectively neutralized pseu-\nD\ndovirus ­(IC = 0.6 µg/mL) [ 88 ]. Notably, the RBD affinity\n50\n( K = 225 pM) and neutralization efficiency (~ 100-fold,\nD\n­IC = 0.007 µg/mL) was drastically enhanced by the biva-\n50\nlent Sb23-Fc construct [ 88 ]. Sb23 showed higher RBD\naffinity than ACE2, competes with ACE2 for RBD binding\nsites, and binds to RBD in the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conforma-\ntion, therefore effectively blocking the SARS-CoV-2–ACE2\ninteraction [ 88 ]. Additionally, Sb23 could be combined with\nother Sbs (Sb12, 76, and 100) that simultaneously bind RBD\nand decrease ACE2 binding affinity [ 88 ].\n\n205\nPreviously, synthetic Nbs that effectively disrupt the\nS–ACE2 interaction and inhibit pseudovirus infection\nwere produced [ 11 ]. Nb6 and Nb11 targeted the RBD\nand impeded ACE2 binding, while Nb3 targeted different\nepitopes and reduced the S–ACE2 interaction. Nb6 binds to\nS2P ­Spike ( K = 210nM) and to RBD alone ( K = 41 nM),\nD D\nS2P whereas Nb3 binds to ­Spike ( K = 61 nM), but there\nD\nwas no indication of binding to the RBD alone [ 11 ]. Nb6\nand Nb11 were shown to be the most potent clones, with\n­IC values of 370 and 540 nM, respectively. They recognize\n50\nRBD epitopes overlapping the binding site of ACE2 [ 11 ] and\nS2P bind to open and closed ­Spike conformations. Pseudovi-\nrus infection was inhibited by Nb6 ­(IC = 2.0 µM), Nb11\n50\n­(IC = 2.4 μM) and Nb3 ­(IC = 3.9 μM). Nb6 dimerization\n50 50\nand trimerization lead to increases in K of 750-fold and\nD\nK of > 200,000-fold, respectively. A trivalent Nb6 (Nb6-\nD\ntri) Nb was generated to improve the affinity and inhibitory\neffects. The Nb6-tri was extremely potent and neutralized\nlive SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of pseudovirus infection was\n= enhanced to a greater extent by Nb6-tri (2000-fold, ­IC\n50\n1.2 nM) than Nb11-tri (40-fold, ­IC = 51 nM) and Nb3-tri\n50\n(10-fold, ­IC = 400 nM). In the neutralization of live virus\n50\ninfection, Nb6-tri ­(IC = 160 pM) demonstrated greater\n50\npotency than Nb3-tri ­(IC = 140 nM). Thereafter, potency\n50\nwas optimized by the selection of high-affinity mutations,\nwhich led to the production of a mature Nb6 (mNb6). The\nmNb6 showed enhanced binding affinity (500-fold affinity to\nS2P ­Spike ), inhibition of pseudovirus, and live virus infection\n(~ 200-fold). The inhibitory effects were further enhanced\nby the trivalent mNb6 (mNb6-tri), and the neutralization of\nSARS-CoV-2 is due to mNb6-tri locking S into an inactive\nformat [ 11 ]. The mNb6-tri further enhances the inhibition of\npseudovirus ­(IC = 120 pM or 5.0 ng/mL) and live infection\n50\n­(IC = 54 pM or 2.3 ng/mL). Interestingly, mNb6-tri was\n50\nshown to remain stable and functional after heat treatment,\nlyophilization, and aerosolization. This indicates the poten-\ntial of mNb6-tri to be aerosolically delivered directly into the\nlungs, which may allow for patient-friendly administration\nof a preventative/therapeutic drug against COVID-19 [ 11 ].\nThree high-quality potent Nbs (Nb21, Nb20 and Nb89)\ndemonstrated high affinities, pseudovirus neutralization, and\nthermostability (Nb89 = 65.9°, Nb20 = 71.8°, and Nb21 =\n72.8°C) [ 89 ]. Interestingly, three copies of Nb20 or Nb21\nshowed simultaneous binding of all three RBDs in the inac-\ntive ‘down’ conformation [ 89 ]. The SPR showed the binding\naffinities of Nb89 (108 pM) and Nb20 (10.4 pM). Pseudovi-\nrus was neutralized by Nb89 (0.133 nM), Nb20 (0.102 nM),\nand Nb21 (0.045 nM). Moreover, live virus was neutralized\nby Nb89 (0.154 nM), Nb20 (0.048 nM), and Nb21 (0.022\nnM). The Nb21 on-shelf stability after purification was ~ 6\nweeks at room temperature. In comparison with the mono-\nmeric Nbs, the homotrimeric Nbs ­(Nb21 and ­Nb20 ) dem-\n3 3\nonstrated an enhanced (~ 30-fold) inhibition of pseudovirus",

The potent\nMR3 binds the RBD ( K = 1.0 nM), neutralizes the pseu-\nD\n-1 dovirus ­(IC = 0.40 μg ­mL ) and competes with ACE2 for\n50\nRBD binding [ 90 ]. On the other hand, SR31 demonstrated\nhigh RBD binding ( K = 5.6 nM) but no neutralizing activi-\nD\nties [ 90 , 91 ]. Yao et al. then revealed the potential of SR31 as\na fusion partner for enhancing Nb potency [ 91 ]. Two mod-\nestly neutralizing Sbs (MR17 and MR6) were fused to SR31\n[ 91 ].

These Nbs showed good live virus neutralizing activity\n­(IC = 48–185 nM). VHH E, which binds RBD in the ‘up’\n50\nconformation, was the most potent, and results suggest that\nVHH E induces the three ‘up’ conformations and causes the\n‘down’ conformation to be inaccessible to the RBD [ 12 ].\nEngineered multivalent Nbs (VHH EE and EEE) showed\ngreater neutralizing activities (100 times) [ 12 ]. Both VHH\nEE and VHH EEE showed enhanced neutralization of the\npseudotyped virus (EE ­IC = 930 pM; and EEE ­IC = 520\n50 50\npM) and live wild-type virus ­(IC = 180–170 pM). Moreo-\n50\nver, a mixture of two Nbs that bind to different epitopes\ndemonstrated enhanced neutralization and prevention of\nreplication [ 12 ]. Notably, biparatopic Nbs (VHH VE and\nEV) showed substantially higher (more than eight times)\nbinding strength (VE [ K = 84 pM] and EV [ K = 200 pM])\nD D\nand pseudotyped VSV neutralization (VE and EV, ­IC =\n50\n4.1–2.9 nM) than E alone [ 12 ]. Targeting two neutralizing\nepitopes simultaneously with biparatopic Nbs inhibits the\nemergence of escape mutants [ 12 ].\nGai et al. produced six Nbs that showed good binding\ncapacity ( K = 21.6–106 nM) to S RBD wild-type and\nD\neight mutants (Q321L, V341I, N354D, V367F, K378R,\nV483A, Y508H, and H519P), and also blocked the inter-\naction between the eight mutants of RBD and ACE2\n[ 92 ]. There were varying levels of RBD–ACE2 block-\ning activity for Nb8 87 (16.2%), Nb13 58 (50.4%), and ‐ ‐\nNb11 59 (98.9%). All Nbs had half maximal neutralization ‐\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\nconcentrations ­(EC ) and ­IC values lower than 0.2 and\n50 50\n1 μg/mL, respectively.

The Nb11 59 was humanized (HuNb11 59) and ‐ ‐\nexpressed in Pichia pastoris , which produced extremely\nlarge amounts (20 g/L titer) of HuNb11 59 in minimal ‐\ntime (213 h) [ 92 ]. Thereafter, HuNb11 59 showed high ‐\npurity (99.36%), great stability, and neutralization activ-\nity, indicating potential inhalation delivery and successful\ncommercialization [ 92 ].\nThe Pittsburgh inhalable Nb 21 (PiN-21) is an extremely\npotent homotrimeric construct that demonstrated efficient\nprevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [ 5 ]. In the\nrespiratory tract of Syrian hamsters, intranasal PiN-21 (0.6\nmg/kg) delivery substantially inhibited viral replication [ 5 ].\nTherefore, the beneficial effects of PiN-21 in vitro was also\nseen in vivo [ 5 ]. Aerosol PiN-21 (~ 0.2 mg/kg) delivery\nextremely decreased viral load and prevented pneumonia and\nlung damage in Syrian hamsters [ 5 ]. Thus, human-to-human\nvirus transmission may be restricted by aerosol-mediated Nb\nadministration [ 5 ]. The administration of PiN-21 through\ninhalation at an early stage of disease was shown to effec-\ntively reduce virus entry and replication, indicating disease\nprevention [ 5 ]. Thus, PiN-21 showed great efficacy for the\nprevention and treatment of COVID-19 [ 5 ].\nPymm et al. identified several high affinity Nbs (WNb 2,\n= 0.14–19.49 nM]) that WNb 7, WNb 15, and WNb 36 [ K\nD\ndisrupted the RBD–ACE2 interaction and neutralized the\nvirus (3–36108 nM) [ 17 ]. The Nb-Fc fusions bind to dis-\ntinct antigenic sites on RBD (nM), inhibit ACE2–RBD\ninteraction, and bind to most RBD variants ­(EC 0.7–14\n50\nnM). Nb-Fc (WNb 2, 7, 15, and 36) binds to wild-type RBD\n­(EC = 0.97–2.65 nM), but showed decreased binding to\n50\neither E484K or N501Y variant RBDs. The Nb-Fc fusions\nbind to wild-type RBD and the N501Y variant at K < 0.55\nD\nnM.

The potent Nb-Fcs were shown\nto impede the interaction between variants (N501Y, and to\na greater extent, E484K ­[IC = 0.04–0.19 nM]) RBD and\n50\nACE2 and potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (wild-type ­[IC\n50\n= 0.10–3.18 nM] and N501Y D614G ­[IC = 0.11–5.04\n50\nnM] variants) [ 17 ]. Additionally, in N501Y D614G variant-\ninfected mice, prophylactic Nb-Fc (alone or in combination)\nadministration decreased viral loads, indicating their poten-\ntial for COVID-19 prevention [ 17 ].\nVHH-72 Nb was generated against SARS-CoV-1 RBD,\nhowever VHH-72 was able to cross-react with the SARS-\nCoV-2 RBD [ 75 ].

In comparison with CR3022, VHH-72 prevents\nACE2–SARS-CoV-2 binding [ 75 ]. Thereafter, multivalent\nVHH-72 Nbs were engineered in order to enhance neutrali-\nzation activities [ 14 ].

Interestingly, the neutralizing potency of the multi-\n= ± valent VHH-72 could be greater than the S309 ­(IC\n50\n1.9 n ) mAb [ 14 ]. In addition, the multivalent VHH 72 Nbs ‐\nm\ndemonstrated advantageous biophysical properties (low off ‐\ntarget binding, high stability and solubility), indicating their\npotential as therapeutic agents [ 14 ].\nThe Nanosota-1A Nb showed excessive neutralization\npotency, and affinity maturation resulted in Nanosota-\n1B and then Nanosota-1C [ 48 ]. Nanosota-1A , -1B , and\n-1C bind RBD with increasing affinity ( K = 228–14 nM)\nd\nand effectively inhibit viral infection in vitro . Furthermore,\nNanosota-1 strongly neutralizes pseudoviruses bearing the\nD614G mutation [ 48 ]. Nanosota-1C was shown to access the\nS protein in the accessible and inaccessible states [ 48 ]. Both\nNanosota-1C and Nanosota-1C-Fc compete with ACE2 to\nbind RBD [ 48 ]. In order to inhibit the virus–ACE2 bind-\ning, a Nb needs to bind to RBD more strongly than ACE2\n[ 48 ]. In comparison with ACE2, Nanosota-1C-Fc did in\nfact bind more strongly. Notably, Nanosota-1C-Fc binds\nRBD with the highest affinity ( K = 15.7 pM) and ~ 3000\nd\ntimes tighter than ACE2 [ 48 ]. Both Nanosota-1C-Fc and\nNanosota-1C potently inhibited pseudovirus entry as well\nas live virus infection [ 48 ]. Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated\npotent pseudovirus neutralization ­(ND = 0.27 μg/mL and\n50\n­ND = 3.12 μg/mL), which was ~ 10 times greater than\n90\nNanosota-1C and ~ 160 times greater than ACE2. Nanosota-\n1C-Fc also potently neutralizes live virus infection ­(ND =\n50\n0.16 μg/mL), again to a greater extent than Nanosota-1C and\nACE2. In vivo , in hamster and mouse models, Nanosota-\n1C-Fc (10–20 mg/kg) showed preventive as well as thera-\npeutic effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 live infection [ 48 ].\nAdditionally, Nanosota-1C-Fc demonstrated exceptional\nthermostability (−80°C, 4°C, 25°C, or 37°C for 1 week),\nin vivo stability (10 days) and tissue bioavailability (after 3\n\n207\ndays) [ 48 ]. Therefore, Nanosota-1C-Fc may be an effective\nand inexpensive treatment against COVID-19 [ 48 ].\nHuo et al. produced four Nbs (C5, H3, C1, F2) with high\nbinding affinity ( K = 20–615 pM) and demonstrated that\nD\nACE2 binding was blocked by C1, H3 and C5, whereas it\nwas unaffected by F2 [ 93 ]. C1 and F2 were shown to bind\nto the Alpha, Beta and Victoria strains at similar affini-\nties, whereas C5 and H3 were shown to bind to only the\nAlpha and Victoria strain, and not the Beta strain. [ 93 ]. The\nC5 binds to RBD ( K = ± 210 pM) and S ( K = ± 350 pM)\nD D\nwith high affinity and neutralized the Victoria ­(IC =\n50\n18 pM) and Alpha ­(IC = 25 pM) strains. The C1 was active\n50\nagainst the Beta strain. Trimeric (C5, C1 and H3) Nbs bind\nto RBD at an enhanced K (10- to 100-fold) and showed\nD\npotent virus (Victoria, Alpha or Beta strains) neutralization\n[ 93 ]. The C5 trimer showed enhanced neutralization potency\nagainst the live Victoria strain ­(ND = 3 pM), and C5-Fc\n50\nshowed RBD binding affinity ( K = 37 pM) and virus neu-\nD\n= 2 pM) similar to the trivalent tralization potency ­(ND\n50\nC5. Regarding RBD binding, C1 and F2 competed with\nCR3022, whereas C5 and H3 competed with H11-H4. In the\nSyrian hamster model, intraperitoneal (IP) administration of\nC5-Fc (4 mg/kg) showed therapeutic efficacy [ 93 ]. Addition-\nally, in the hamster model, IP and intranasal administration\nof the trimeric C5 Nb showed therapeutic benefit [ 93 ].\nWu et al. isolated three Nbs ­(Nb -Fc, ­Nb -Fc, and\n15 22\n­Nb -Fc) that showed specific RBD binding ( K =\n31 D\n1.13–1.76 nM) and potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2\n(live virus ­[IC = 41.3–75 pM and ­IC = 195–293.8 pM]\n50 90\nand pseudovirus ­[IC = 10–28.8 pM]) [ 74 ]. The three Nb-\n50\nFcs did not inhibit MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudovi-\nrus. Interestingly these Nb-Fcs inhibited 15 SARS-CoV-2\nvariants. All three Nb-Fcs inhibited the replication of\nSARS-CoV-2 variants with a D614G mutation.

Nota-\n15 H 15\nbly, in transgenic human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, intrana-\nsal ­Nb -Nb -Nb (average of 10 mg/kg) administration\n15 H 15\nshowed substantial prophylactic and therapeutic efficiency\nagainst viral infection [ 74 ].\nGuttler et al. produced various Nbs (e.g. Re6B06,\nRe9F06, Re5D06) that completely prevent infection\n[ 4 ]. Several of these Nbs demonstrated neutralization,\nhyper-thermostability, binding of S protein in the active\nand inactive states, and tight RBD binding [ 4 ]. Addi-\ntionally, Nb tandems were constructed and Nb mono-\nmers were identified that keenly binds RBD which pos-\nsess a mixture of escape mutations (K417T, E484K,\nN501Y, L452R), indicating high mutational tolerance\n[ 4 ]. Re5D06 ( K ˜2 pM), Re9B09 ( K ≤1 pM), Re6H06\nD D\n( K ≤1 pM), Re5F10 (˜30 pM), Re9H01 (˜10 pM), and\nD\nRe9H03 (˜25 pM) showed tight RBD binding. Some\nNbs neutralize in the low nM range, such as Re9F06\n(17 nM), Re5F10 (5 nM), Re6B07 (5 nM), and Re6B06\n(50 nM), whereas other Nbs neutralize in the pM range,\ni.e. Re9B09, Re9H01, Re9H03 (167 pM), Re5D06 and\nRe6H06 (50 pM) [ 4 ]. Re5D06, Re6H06 or Re9B09 block\nthe ACE2–RBD interaction, while Re5F10, Re7E02 or\nRe9F06 also competed with ACE2. Re9B09 and Re5D06,\nRe9F06 and Re5F10 are hyperthermostable (90°C,\n5 min) or can robustly refold after heat treatment. The\ntrimerization of Nbs decreased the minimal neutraliza-\ntion concentration (Re9F06 =167 pM; Re6D06 = 17 pM)\n[ 4 ]. The Re5D06–RBD model can accommodate the\nN501Y exchange, and the combination of mutations Beta\n(K417N, E484K, N501Y) or Gamma (K417T, E484K,\n= N501Y) decreased the Re5D06–RBD interaction ( K\nD\n0.1–0.5 nM).\nFusion of Re9F06 to R28 lead to a tandem that binds\nrapidly to the Beta and Gamma variants. A quadruple\n(K417T, L452R, E484K, N501Y) RBD mutant that\ncontains several mutations was produced. The Re9F06 ‐\nR28 tandem was shown to bind to the mutated variants.\nRe6H06 showed ≤ 10 pM binding to either the Beta\nor Gamma, and Re9H03 binds mostly irreversibly to\nGamma, Beta variants, and the quadruple mutant. Lastly,\nthere was potent B.1.351 neutralization by monomers\n(Re5F10 [1.7 nM], Re6H06 [170 pM], Re9B09 [1.7 nM],\nRe9H03 [50–170 pM]) and tandems (Re9F06 R28 [50 ‐\npM], Re9F06 Re9B09 [50 pM], and Re9F06 Re6H06 ‐ ‐\n[17 pM] [ 4 ].\nThe K-874A Nb was generated and binds specifically\nto the S1 protein with high affinity ( K = 1.4 nM) and\nd\nneutralizes the B.1.1.7 variant ­(IC = ± 5.74 μg/mL),\n50\nbut not the other variants [ 94 ]. Interestingly, the K-874A\nNb does not reduce/prevent viral attachment to the ACE2\n\nD. B. Naidoo, A. A. Chuturgoon\n[ 94 ]. Instead, K-874A blocks the fusion between the\nvirus membrane and the host cell, which inhibits viral\nentry [ 94 ]. In infected Syrian hamsters, intranasal admin-\nistration of K-874A (30 mg/kg) was shown to decrease\nviral RNA copies in the lungs and inhibit the increase of\ncytokine levels [ 94 ].\nAnother biparatopic Nb (NM1268) was produced\n(NM1228 and NM1226) that targets different epitopes\ninside the RBD–ACE2 interface [ 78 ]. Both NM1267 and\nNM1268 showed strong RBD binding affinity. NM1268\ndemonstrated picomolar affinities to ­RBD , block-\nB.1\nage of the ACE2–antigen interaction at low picomolar\nrange, high stability and production at a high purity and\nyield [ 78 ]. Both biparatopic Nbs efficiently bind with\nhigh affinity to several variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma,\nDelta) and were shown to neutralize the Beta and Delta\nvariants in vitro [ 78 ]. NM1267 neutralized B.1 ­(IC =\n50\n0.33nM), B.1.351 ­(IC = 0.78  nM) and B.1.617.2\n50\n= 52.55 nM). NM1268 showed strong neutraliza- ­(IC\n50\ntion potency for B.1 ­(IC = 2.37 nM), B.1.351 ­(IC =\n50 50\n6.06 nM), and B.1.617.2 ­(IC = 0.67 nM). Addition-\n50\nally, in K18-hACE2 mice, the prophylactic intranasal\nNM1267 and NM1268 Nb (20 µg) treatment was shown\nto inhibit virus-induced (B.1, B.1.351 or B.1.617.2)\ninfection, virus shedding, disease progression and mor-\ntality [ 78 ]. Prophylactic NM1267 treatment decreased\nlung tissue damage induced by virus and inflammation\nin B.1 infected mice. ‐\nThe potent NIH-CoVnb-112 Nb demonstrated strong\nbinding affinity (4.9 nM) to S RBD and effectively inter-\nferes with the S RBD–ACE2 interaction with a ­EC of\n50\n0.02 µg/mL [ 95 ]. Notably, the affinity of monomeric\nNIH-CoVnb-112 was substantially better than other\nmonomeric Nbs (VHH72, Ty1, Sb#14, and Sb23) [ 95 ]. In\ncomparison with the S RBD wild-type, many variants of\nS RBD (N354D D364Y, V367F, and W436R) have shown\nextremely higher affinity for ACE2 (100-fold) in vitro\n[ 95 ]. Remarkably, NIH-CoVnb-112 binding affinity to\nthese variants, as well as its ability to block the interac-\ntion between the variants and ACE2, were similar to its\neffects with the wild-type S RBD [ 95 ]. In vitro , pseudo-\ntyped lentivirus infection was shown to be blocked by\nNIH-CoVnb-112 [ 95 ]. Interestingly, NIH-CoVnb-112\nand VHH-72 bind to different epitopes and their combi-\nnation led to additive effects [ 95 ]. Post-nebulization of\nNIHCoVnb-112 showed that a large percentage (> 90%)\nof total input protein was recovered, it maintains effec-\ntiveness and there was no sign of degradation/aggrega-\ntion products following exposure to physiological tem-\nperature (37°C, 24 h). NIH-CoVnb-112 also showed\nvariant neutralization of Alpha ­(EC = 9.4 nM), Beta\n50\n­(EC = 15.8 nM), Gamma ­(EC = 17.6 nM), and Delta\n50 50\n­(EC = 14.5 nM) in vitro [ 95 ].\n50",

Unfortunately,\nthese challenges may negatively impact worldwide acces-\nsibility of COVID-19 diagnosis tests and treatments [ 5 ].\nNotably, Nbs are an advantageous diagnostic and ther-\napeutic option. The utilization of Nbs may overcome the\nchallenges faced with current detection assays and medi-\ncines. Additionally, the potential aerosolization and inha-\nlation delivery of Nbs allows for targeted treatment deliv-\nery as well as patient self-administration. Notably, Nbs\ncan be rapidly and inexpensively generated, modified,\ntested ( in vitro and in vivo ), produced in large quantities,\nand developed into diagnosis tests as well as treatments.\nAlthough most SARS-CoV-2 Nbs have demonstrated\nhigh neutralization potency in vitro , further research\nis required to determine whether in vitro Nb potency is\ntranslated into in vivo and clinical therapeutic efficacy\n[ 5 , 9 ]. Taken together, Nbs are proving to be a highly\npromising diagnosis and treatment option for COVID-19.\nThe authors are grateful to the National Research Acknowledgements\nfoundation (120792 and 120820), SAMRC (JAF # 2020/127) and Uni-\nversity of KwaZulu-Natal for financial support.\nDeclarations\nThis research was funded by the National Research founda- Funding\ntion (grant numbers 120792 and 120820), SAMRC (JAF # 2020/127),\nand University of KwaZulu-Natal.\nDhaneshree Bestinee Naidoo and Anil Amichund Conflict of interest\nChuturgoon declare they have no conflicts of interest.\nNot applicable.
