RBA focuses on using a data-driven decision-making process to shift from merely discussing problems to actively solving them. It emphasizes starting with desired outcomes and then determining the means to achieve them. RBA aims to promote community impact, such as ensuring \"children ready for school\" or \"a safe and clean neighborhood\" (References: [1], [2], [3]).\n\n2. **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)**:\n   - Established on January 14, 1960, the Reserve Bank of Australia serves as the nation's central bank and banknote issuing authority.
