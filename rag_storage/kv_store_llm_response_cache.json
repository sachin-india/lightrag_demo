SARS-CoV-2 has fostered the need for change\\nin the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\\ninfections. On the other hand, developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic technologies is now\\nmore challenging due to emerging variants and varying symptoms exhibited among the\\ninfected individuals. In addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and\\nprotection against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being developed\\nunleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated variants.\\nIn this review, we provide an updated perspective on the current challenges posed by the\\nemergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants/variants and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to\\nenable their detection. In addition, we also discuss the development, formulation, working\\nmechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks of some of the most used vaccines/therapeutic drugs\\nand their subsequent immunological impact.\\nKEY MESSAGE\\n\\u0001 The emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2 in the past couple of months, highlights\\none of the primary challenges in the diagnostics, treatment, as well as vaccine development\\nagainst the virus.\\n\\u0001 Advancements in SARS-CoV-2 detection include nucleic acid based, antigen and immuno-\\nassay-based and antibody-based detection methodologies for efficient, robust, and quick test-\\ning; while advancements in COVID-19 preventive and therapeutic strategies include novel\\nantiviral and immunomodulatory drugs and SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines.\\n\\u0001 The varied COVID-19 vaccine platforms and the immune responses induced by each one of\\nthem as well as their ability to battle post-vaccination infections have all been discussed in\\nthis review.\\n1.

SARS-CoV-2 has fostered the need for change\\nin the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\\ninfections. On the other hand, developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic technologies is now\\nmore challenging due to emerging variants and varying symptoms exhibited among the\\ninfected individuals. In addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and\\nprotection against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being developed\\nunleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 and its associated variants.\\nIn this review, we provide an updated perspective on the current challenges posed by the\\nemergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants/variants and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to\\nenable their detection. In addition, we also discuss the development, formulation, working\\nmechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks of some of the most used vaccines/therapeutic drugs\\nand their subsequent immunological impact.\\nKEY MESSAGE\\n\\u0001 The emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2 in the past couple of months, highlights\\none of the primary challenges in the diagnostics, treatment, as well as vaccine development\\nagainst the virus.\\n\\u0001 Advancements in SARS-CoV-2 detection include nucleic acid based, antigen and immuno-\\nassay-based and antibody-based detection methodologies for efficient, robust, and quick test-\\ning; while advancements in COVID-19 preventive and therapeutic strategies include novel\\nantiviral and immunomodulatory drugs and SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines.\\n\\u0001 The varied COVID-19 vaccine platforms and the immune responses induced by each one of\\nthem as well as their ability to battle post-vaccination infections have all been discussed in\\nthis review.\\n1.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

However, such challenges could be overcome\\n– through the use of multi-target assays [ 14 17 ]. In add-\\nition, studies are now also developing specific primers\\nto enable the rapid detection of VOCs through real-\\ntime PCR; For example, a particular group reported\\nthe development of PCR primers for the rapid detec-\\ntion of the key mutations in the spike protein of the\\nmost recent omicron variant, thus enabling it to be\\n\\n--- Page 5 ---\\n528 Q. FERNANDES ET AL.\\ndistinguished from other SARS-CoV-2 variants [ 18 ].\\nAnother study also described the development of two\\nnew PCR- based tests to identify and differentiate the\\nVOCs from regular strains of SARS-CoV-2. These tests\\nare claimed to be comparatively simpler and more\\nrapid than the gold standard methods of genome\\nsequencing [ 19 ]. The group also claims that these tests\\nshow a strong and reliable correlation to the results\\nobtained through genome sequencing. Apart from\\nthese, other groups have also reported the develop-\\nment and use of similar PCR-based tests for detection\\nof novel VOCs [ 20 , 21 ].\\nIn addition, loop-mediated isothermal amplification\\n(LAMP) has also been developed as a rapid, robust\\nand cheap technique that is now considered as a reli-\\nable alternative to traditional RT-PCR-based diagnosis\\n[ 22 ]. Interestingly, using LAMP, expensive equipment\\nlike thermocyclers may be eliminated thereby high-\\nlighting the portability of such rapid tests. Moreover,\\nthis technique is also highly specific as it uses about\\n– 6 8 specific primer sequences to identify eight differ-\\nent regions of the target [ 13 ]. Further, Clustered\\nRegularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats\\n(CRISPR) is another novel technology that follows the\\nprinciple of lateral flow assays. This assay is known to\\ntarget the E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. The CRISPR-\\nCas13 assays are known to have a sensitivity of\\ngreater than 95% and specificity of nearly 99% [ 23 ]\\nIn addition, microarray-based technology is also\\ncurrently being used to detect viral RNA. Here,\\nlabelled cDNA molecules synthesized from viral RNA\\nhybridized with solid-phase oligonucleotides on the\\nsurface of an array plate are quantified with the help\\nof a microarray plate reader [ 24 ].\\nNext-generation gene sequencing (NGS) methods\\nare also common for the detection of viral presence\\nand helps in understanding the epidemiology of\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. However, although NGS platforms\\nare accurate and reliable, their practical application is\\noften limited due the involvement of higher costs and\\nexpertise [ 13 ]. However, whole-genome sequence\\nremains to be the gold standard for the detection of\\nemerging VOCs across the globe. Apparently, since\\nthis method is more prolonged and laborious, many\\nstudies have come up with faster and similarly robust\\nPCR melting temperature assays that are largely com-\\nparable to genome sequencing [ 25 , 26 ]. Interestingly,\\nanother group has also reported the development of\\nalternate sequencing platforms based on Sangers\\nsequencing of a single PCR fragment that is capable\\nof identifying and distinguishing all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs\\nthat have been identified so far [ 27 ].\\n\\n2.2.

These tests\\nare claimed to be comparatively simpler and more\\nrapid than the gold standard methods of genome\\nsequencing [ 19 ]. The group also claims that these tests\\nshow a strong and reliable correlation to the results\\nobtained through genome sequencing. Apart from\\nthese, other groups have also reported the develop-\\nment and use of similar PCR-based tests for detection\\nof novel VOCs [ 20 , 21 ].\\nIn addition, loop-mediated isothermal amplification\\n(LAMP) has also been developed as a rapid, robust\\nand cheap technique that is now considered as a reli-\\nable alternative to traditional RT-PCR-based diagnosis\\n[ 22 ]. Interestingly, using LAMP, expensive equipment\\nlike thermocyclers may be eliminated thereby high-\\nlighting the portability of such rapid tests. Moreover,\\nthis technique is also highly specific as it uses about\\n– 6 8 specific primer sequences to identify eight differ-\\nent regions of the target [ 13 ]. Further, Clustered\\nRegularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats\\n(CRISPR) is another novel technology that follows the\\nprinciple of lateral flow assays. This assay is known to\\ntarget the E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. The CRISPR-\\nCas13 assays are known to have a sensitivity of\\ngreater than 95% and specificity of nearly 99% [ 23 ]\\nIn addition, microarray-based technology is also\\ncurrently being used to detect viral RNA. Here,\\nlabelled cDNA molecules synthesized from viral RNA\\nhybridized with solid-phase oligonucleotides on the\\nsurface of an array plate are quantified with the help\\nof a microarray plate reader [ 24 ].\\nNext-generation gene sequencing (NGS) methods\\nare also common for the detection of viral presence\\nand helps in understanding the epidemiology of\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. However, although NGS platforms\\nare accurate and reliable, their practical application is\\noften limited due the involvement of higher costs and\\nexpertise [ 13 ]. However, whole-genome sequence\\nremains to be the gold standard for the detection of\\nemerging VOCs across the globe. Apparently, since\\nthis method is more prolonged and laborious, many\\nstudies have come up with faster and similarly robust\\nPCR melting temperature assays that are largely com-\\nparable to genome sequencing [ 25 , 26 ]. Interestingly,\\nanother group has also reported the development of\\nalternate sequencing platforms based on Sangers\\nsequencing of a single PCR fragment that is capable\\nof identifying and distinguishing all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs\\nthat have been identified so far [ 27 ].\\n\\n2.2.

Therefore,\\nsince reports have proved that the sequences respon-\\nsible for viral RdRp activity remains to be conserved in\\nearly and novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is unlikely that\\nthe novel VOCs could interfere in the activity of such\\nantiviral drugs. Moreover, other reports also advocate\\nthe unrestricted use of the recent FDA approved\\nPaxlovid antiviral drug against the existing VOCs and\\nespecially the most recent omicron variant [ 56 ].\\nTherefore, in the light of the above knowledge it may\\nbe safe to state that the activity of such antivirals may\\nremain unhindered against the emerging VOCs.\\n3.2. Covid-19 vaccines\\nIn addition to the above elucidated drugs vaccines\\nremain the cornerstone of prevention and protection\\nagainst infection. Below we discuss the development,\\nformulation, working mechanisms, advantages, and\\nchallenges of some of the most used vaccines world-\\nwide ( Figure 2 ). In addition, we also provide an over-\\nview of the ongoing trials and cutting-edge research\\nfocussed on vaccine efficacy and safety.\\n3.2.1. Protein subunit vaccines NVX-CoV2373\\nNVX-CoV2373 (Novavax ) is a SARS-COV-2 subunit vac-\\ncine constructed from the full-length SARS- COV-2\\nspike glycoprotein and is produced in the established\\nbaculovirus-Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell\\nexpression system [ 57 ]. This vaccine is formulated\\nthrough the use of nanoparticles containing trimeric\\nfull-length SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein adjuvant with\\nsaponin based Matrix-M [ 58 ]. Studies have shown that\\nthis Matrix-M can enhance immune responses by pro-\\nmoting the recruitment, activation, and maturation of\\n\\nvia central immune cells enhanced antigen presenta-\\ntion and uptake by the antigen presenting cells [ 59 ].\\nThe safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373\\nwas initially tested in a nonhuman primate (baboons\\nand cynomolgus macaque) and mice models.\\nPreliminary results showed that the vaccine elicits a T\\ncell and B cell response, induces a high titre of anti-S\\nIgG and SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies and pro-\\ntects the upper and lower respiratory track from virus\\ninfection and pulmonary disease [ 57 , 60 ]. Subsequently,\\nPhase 1-2 clinical trial were conducted to evaluate the\\nsafety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombin-\\nant S nanoparticle vaccine on humans with or without\\nMatrix-M adjuvant [ 58 ]. The outcomes of these trials\\nindicated that the vaccine has a reassuring safety pro-\\nfile and is capable of inducing a robust humoral and T\\ncell immune response [ 61 ]. Moreover, the levels of\\nneutralizing antibodies and anti-S IgG detected in vac-\\ncinated participants was indeed found to be 4 times\\nhigher than those observed in symptomatic COVID-19\\noutpatient sera [ 61 ]. In addition, this vaccine also indu-\\nþ ces a predominant CD4 T cell response characterized\\nc a by high production of IFN- , IL-2\n```",

SARS-CoV-2 antigen and immuno-assay-based\\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 infection\\nAntigen-based immuno-assays such as immunofluores-\\ncent assays, immunochromatographic assays, chemilu-\\nminescent immunoassays, and Enzyme Linked\\nImmunosorbent Assays (ELISA) are also reliable meth-\\nods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These\\ncommercially available kits are usually compatible with\\na variety of clinical specimens like nasopharyngeal\\nswabs, nasal swabs, and saliva and mainly detect the\\npresence of two main SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S and N\\nproteins) [ 28 ]. However, the success rate of these\\nassays is largely dependent on factors such as disease\\n– – stage and viral load (1 3 days before to 5 7 days after\\nthe onset of symptoms). To address these issues,\\nresearch on incorporating novel sensor and biosensor\\ntechnologies, to enhance the sensitivity of these anti-\\ngen-based immuno- assays is currently ongoing. [ 13 ].\\n2.3. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 infection\\nIn contrast with nucleic acids and antigen-based\\ndetection techniques, antibody-based techniques are\\nnot considered suitable for the early detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection. This is due to the fact that anti-\\nbody responses are often generated nearly two weeks\\npost-infection; a time-point at which viral nucleic acid\\nand antigen levels begin to decline [ 12 ]. Various bind-\\ning assays like immunofluorescence, immunochroma-\\ntographic, chemiluminescence assays and ELISA are\\nused for the detection of antibodies generated specific\\nto the SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen. Most of these kits tar-\\nget the antibodies generated against the viral S and N\\nproteins. Various easy-to-use kits are now available\\nthat are based on measuring the ratio between the\\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)\\nin the blood. [ 28 ]. In addition, humoral immune\\nresponses to SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected using\\nsimple blotting systems [ 29 ]. These are often auto-\\nmated rapid capillary-based platforms through which\\nthe reactivity of human IgGs (in serum or plasma sam-\\nples) against five key SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens [ 29 ].\\nEvidently, the constant development of newer and\\nimproved methods for the detection of novel VOCs is\\nof primary importance to keep pace with their rapid\\nemergence. This will also play a key role in monitoring\\nand curbing the spread of the new variants.\\n\\n--- Page 6 ---\\n3. Advancements in COVID-19 preventive &\\ntherapeutic strategies\\n3.1. Antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs\\nCurrent treatment options for COVID-19 are apparently\\nstratified into two categories; being either antivirals or\\nimmune modifiers [ 30 ]. In the case of antiviral drugs,\\nRemdesivir has gained sufficient recognition for its\\nability to contain and manage the viral load and was\\napproved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19\\npatients with pneumonia concurrent with the shortage\\nof oxygen supply [ 30 ].

Therefore,\\nsince reports have proved that the sequences respon-\\nsible for viral RdRp activity remains to be conserved in\\nearly and novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is unlikely that\\nthe novel VOCs could interfere in the activity of such\\nantiviral drugs. Moreover, other reports also advocate\\nthe unrestricted use of the recent FDA approved\\nPaxlovid antiviral drug against the existing VOCs and\\nespecially the most recent omicron variant [ 56 ].\\nTherefore, in the light of the above knowledge it may\\nbe safe to state that the activity of such antivirals may\\nremain unhindered against the emerging VOCs.\\n3.2. Covid-19 vaccines\\nIn addition to the above elucidated drugs vaccines\\nremain the cornerstone of prevention and protection\\nagainst infection. Below we discuss the development,\\nformulation, working mechanisms, advantages, and\\nchallenges of some of the most used vaccines world-\\nwide ( Figure 2 ). In addition, we also provide an over-\\nview of the ongoing trials and cutting-edge research\\nfocussed on vaccine efficacy and safety.\\n3.2.1. Protein subunit vaccines NVX-CoV2373\\nNVX-CoV2373 (Novavax ) is a SARS-COV-2 subunit vac-\\ncine constructed from the full-length SARS- COV-2\\nspike glycoprotein and is produced in the established\\nbaculovirus-Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell\\nexpression system [ 57 ]. This vaccine is formulated\\nthrough the use of nanoparticles containing trimeric\\nfull-length SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein adjuvant with\\nsaponin based Matrix-M [ 58 ]. Studies have shown that\\nthis Matrix-M can enhance immune responses by pro-\\nmoting the recruitment, activation, and maturation of\\n\\nvia central immune cells enhanced antigen presenta-\\ntion and uptake by the antigen presenting cells [ 59 ].\\nThe safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373\\nwas initially tested in a nonhuman primate (baboons\\nand cynomolgus macaque) and mice models.\\nPreliminary results showed that the vaccine elicits a T\\ncell and B cell response, induces a high titre of anti-S\\nIgG and SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies and pro-\\ntects the upper and lower respiratory track from virus\\ninfection and pulmonary disease [ 57 , 60 ]. Subsequently,\\nPhase 1-2 clinical trial were conducted to evaluate the\\nsafety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombin-\\nant S nanoparticle vaccine on humans with or without\\nMatrix-M adjuvant [ 58 ]. The outcomes of these trials\\nindicated that the vaccine has a reassuring safety pro-\\nfile and is capable of inducing a robust humoral and T\\ncell immune response [ 61 ]. Moreover, the levels of\\nneutralizing antibodies and anti-S IgG detected in vac-\\ncinated participants was indeed found to be 4 times\\nhigher than those observed in symptomatic COVID-19\\noutpatient sera [ 61 ].

SARS-CoV-2 antigen and immuno-assay-based\\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 infection\\nAntigen-based immuno-assays such as immunofluores-\\ncent assays, immunochromatographic assays, chemilu-\\nminescent immunoassays, and Enzyme Linked\\nImmunosorbent Assays (ELISA) are also reliable meth-\\nods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These\\ncommercially available kits are usually compatible with\\na variety of clinical specimens like nasopharyngeal\\nswabs, nasal swabs, and saliva and mainly detect the\\npresence of two main SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S and N\\nproteins) [ 28 ]. However, the success rate of these\\nassays is largely dependent on factors such as disease\\n– – stage and viral load (1 3 days before to 5 7 days after\\nthe onset of symptoms). To address these issues,\\nresearch on incorporating novel sensor and biosensor\\ntechnologies, to enhance the sensitivity of these anti-\\ngen-based immuno- assays is currently ongoing. [ 13 ].\\n2.3. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 infection\\nIn contrast with nucleic acids and antigen-based\\ndetection techniques, antibody-based techniques are\\nnot considered suitable for the early detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection. This is due to the fact that anti-\\nbody responses are often generated nearly two weeks\\npost-infection; a time-point at which viral nucleic acid\\nand antigen levels begin to decline [ 12 ]. Various bind-\\ning assays like immunofluorescence, immunochroma-\\ntographic, chemiluminescence assays and ELISA are\\nused for the detection of antibodies generated specific\\nto the SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen. Most of these kits tar-\\nget the antibodies generated against the viral S and N\\nproteins. Various easy-to-use kits are now available\\nthat are based on measuring the ratio between the\\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)\\nin the blood. [ 28 ]. In addition, humoral immune\\nresponses to SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected using\\nsimple blotting systems [ 29 ]. These are often auto-\\nmated rapid capillary-based platforms through which\\nthe reactivity of human IgGs (in serum or plasma sam-\\nples) against five key SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens [ 29 ].\\nEvidently, the constant development of newer and\\nimproved methods for the detection of novel VOCs is\\nof primary importance to keep pace with their rapid\\nemergence. This will also play a key role in monitoring\\nand curbing the spread of the new variants.\\n\\n--- Page 6 ---\\n3. Advancements in COVID-19 preventive &\\ntherapeutic strategies\\n3.1.

In the case of antiviral drugs,\\nRemdesivir has gained sufficient recognition for its\\nability to contain and manage the viral load and was\\napproved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19\\npatients with pneumonia concurrent with the shortage\\nof oxygen supply [ 30 ].

In the case of antiviral drugs,\\nRemdesivir has gained sufficient recognition for its\\nability to contain and manage the viral load and was\\napproved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19\\npatients with pneumonia concurrent with the shortage\\nof oxygen supply [ 30 ]. It is a broad-spectrum adeno-\\nsine nucleotide analogue and phosphoramidate pro-\\ndrug that can target a wide range of viruses includes\\ncoronaviruses. The drug mainly functions through the\\ninhibition of replication in the respiratory-associated\\nepithelial cells [ 31 ]. According to a recent report,\\nremdesivir triphosphate, being the active form of\\nRemdesivir, resembles the RNA of the coronavirus.\\nTherefore, it is easily integrated into nascent viral RNA\\nstrands resulting in halting of viral genome replication\\n[ 32 ]. In addition, another study showed that a combin-\\nation of remdesivir with baricitinib worked better in\\nreducing recovery time of hospitalized patients with\\nCOVID-19 pneumonia [ 33 ]. Baricitinib is a Janus\\n– kinase STAT signalling inhibitor (JAK-STAT) that pos-\\nsesses antiviral and anti-inflammatory action through\\nthe inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and\\ncontrols the elevation of cytokine levels. [ 34 ].\\nMoreover, certain anti-HIV drugs like lopinavir and\\nritonavir that target RNA viruses (retroviruses) were\\nreported to improve the symptoms of patients with SARS\\n[ 35 ]. Therefore, they were evaluated for their potential use\\nas a therapeutic agent against COVID-19. However,\\naccording to a certain report, no benefit was observed\\n– with lopinavir ritonavir treatment beyond standard care\\nin adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 [ 36 ].\\nSimilarly, chloroquine, a drug whose sulphate and phos-\\nphate salts have been commercialized as anti-malarial\\ndrugs was also shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2\\n– infections according to a few studies [ 37 40 ]. However, a\\nrecent trial proved that post-exposure hydroxychloro-\\nquine therapy did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in\\nhealthy individuals exposed to an infected patient [ 41 ]. In\\naddition, other studies have also discredited protease\\ninhibitors like lopinavir and ritonavir and chloroquine to\\nmodel potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy [ 42 , 43 ].\\nRecently, two monoclonal antibodies, Tocilizumab\\nand Sarilumab used as anti-inflammatory drugs for\\nrheumatoid arthritis [ 44 ] have been repurposed for their\\nuse against SARS-CoV-2 Tocilizumab was approved as an\\nimmunotherapy drug by FDA for the treatment against\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 529\\nthe cytokine storm release that is a hallmark of particu-\\nlarly critical COVID-19 infections [ 30 , 45 ]. These monoclo-\\nnal antibodies function by antagonizing both\\nmembrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 receptors\\n[ 44 ], thereby resulting in the blocking of the down-\\nstream signal transduction that induces the cytokine\\nrelease syndrome [ 46 ]. Moreover, the clinical trials of the\\nRandomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive\\nPlatform Trial for Community-Acquired pneumonia\\n(REMAP-CAP) showed that Tocilizumab and Sarilumab\\nimproved survival rate and reduced mortality in hospital-\\nized Covid-19 patients by 28 and 22.2% respectively,\\nwhen administrated within 24h of entering intensive\\ncare units (ICUs) [ 30 , 44 , 47 ]. According to the NHS guid-\\nance, both drugs are advocated for the treatment of\\nhospitalized Covid-19\n```",

According to the NHS guid-\\nance, both drugs are advocated for the treatment of\\nhospitalized Covid-19 patients in ICUs [ 47 ].\\nFurther, Casirivimab with Imdevimab forms a unique\\nTM . monoclonal antibody cocktail named REGEN- COV\\nThese antibodies bind non-competitively to the SARS-\\nCoV-2 spike protein, thus being beneficial in targeting\\nthe novel mutant SARS-CoV-2 variants and lowering\\nchances of their immune escape [ 48 ]. Results of the\\nTM phase 3 trial showed that REGEN-COV decreased hos-\\npitalization or death by 70% in non-hospitalized Covid-\\n19 patients. In addition, it has also been approved by\\nthe FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases in\\nadults and paediatric Covid-19 patients and in patients\\nat high risk of disease severity [ 48 ].\\n3.1.1. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs on the\\nemerging VOCs\\nIn the wake of the recent emergences of new SARS-\\nCoV-2 variants, it has become increasingly important\\nto evaluate whether the current therapeutics still\\nmaintain efficacy against the novel variants. In fact,\\nin-vitro several studies were conducted to assess the\\nefficacy of remdesivir against new COVID- 19 variants\\nand more importantly to determine whether these\\nVOCs expressed mutations in the RNA- Dependent\\nRNA Polymerase (RdRP) protein sequence, which is the\\nmain target of remdesivir. A recent study conducted\\non the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants proved that both\\nvariants presented a low genetic variation in the RNA\\nreplication complex and the most frequent observed\\nsubstitution was Nsp12 P323L. However, this substitu-\\ntion was not located near the polymerase active site,\\nthus did not affect the inhibition function of remdesi-\\nvir [ 49 ]. In addition, according to Lee et al. the amino\\nacid sequences of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs were\\nfound to possess numerous mutations in the spike\\nprotein, when compared to the early SARS-CoV-2\\nstrains [ 50 ]. However, the amino acid sequence of\\n\\n--- Page 7 ---\\n530 Q. FERNANDES ET AL.\\nNSP12, (which possesses RdRp activity), remained to\\nbe highly conserved among both the early and novel\\nvariants [ 50 ]. Moreover, Showers et al. also reported\\nno difference in the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir\\nbetween early SARS-CoV-2 and these new variants\\n[ 51 ]. Furthermore, another study that analyzed the\\nprotein sequence of RdRp among SARS-CoV-2 emer-\\ngent variants show a high conservation in remdesivir-\\nbinding residues [ 52 ]. Therefore, these reports indicate\\ntowards the lack of evidence stating the resistance to\\nremdesivir induced by the VOCs.\\nSimilarly, molnupiravir, a recently FDA approved\\nantiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection is also\\nknown to function through targeting the viral poly-\\nmerase and misdirecting it to incorporate adenosine\\nor guanosine during viral replication, thereby leading\\nto an accumulation of deleterious errors eventually\\n– rendering the\n```",

According to the NHS guid-\\nance, both drugs are advocated for the treatment of\\nhospitalized Covid-19 patients in ICUs [ 47 ].\\nFurther, Casirivimab with Imdevimab forms a unique\\nTM . monoclonal antibody cocktail named REGEN- COV\\nThese antibodies bind non-competitively to the SARS-\\nCoV-2 spike protein, thus being beneficial in targeting\\nthe novel mutant SARS-CoV-2 variants and lowering\\nchances of their immune escape [ 48 ]. Results of the\\nTM phase 3 trial showed that REGEN-COV decreased hos-\\npitalization or death by 70% in non-hospitalized Covid-\\n19 patients. In addition, it has also been approved by\\nthe FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases in\\nadults and paediatric Covid-19 patients and in patients\\nat high risk of disease severity [ 48 ].\\n3.1.1. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs on the\\nemerging VOCs\\nIn the wake of the recent emergences of new SARS-\\nCoV-2 variants, it has become increasingly important\\nto evaluate whether the current therapeutics still\\nmaintain efficacy against the novel variants. In fact,\\nin-vitro several studies were conducted to assess the\\nefficacy of remdesivir against new COVID- 19 variants\\nand more importantly to determine whether these\\nVOCs expressed mutations in the RNA- Dependent\\nRNA Polymerase (RdRP) protein sequence, which is the\\nmain target of remdesivir. A recent study conducted\\non the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants proved that both\\nvariants presented a low genetic variation in the RNA\\nreplication complex and the most frequent observed\\nsubstitution was Nsp12 P323L. However, this substitu-\\ntion was not located near the polymerase active site,\\nthus did not affect the inhibition function of remdesi-\\nvir [ 49 ]. In addition, according to Lee et al. the amino\\nacid sequences of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs were\\nfound to possess numerous mutations in the spike\\nprotein, when compared to the early SARS-CoV-2\\nstrains [ 50 ]. However, the amino acid sequence of\\n\\n--- Page 7 ---\\n530 Q. FERNANDES ET AL.\\nNSP12, (which possesses RdRp activity), remained to\\nbe highly conserved among both the early and novel\\nvariants [ 50 ]. Moreover, Showers et al. also reported\\nno difference in the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir\\nbetween early SARS-CoV-2 and these new variants\\n[ 51 ]. Furthermore, another study that analyzed the\\nprotein sequence of RdRp among SARS-CoV-2 emer-\\ngent variants show a high conservation in remdesivir-\\nbinding residues [ 52 ]. Therefore, these reports indicate\\ntowards the lack of evidence stating the resistance to\\nremdesivir induced by the VOCs.\\nSimilarly, molnupiravir, a recently FDA approved\\nantiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection is also\\nknown to function through targeting the viral poly-\\nmerase and misdirecting it to incorporate adenosine\\nor guanosine during viral replication, thereby leading\\nto an accumulation of deleterious errors eventually\\n– rendering the\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Recombinant adenoviruses\\nhave been widely used for vaccine development such\\nas hepatitis B, Ebola virus, RSV, HIV and Zika vaccines\\nwith an excellent safety profile confirmed in many\\n– clinical studies [ 77 80 ]. Moreover, recombinant adeno-\\nvirus vectors elicit robust long-lasting immune\\nresponse without the need of adjuvant after one or\\ntwo doses of vaccine [ 81 , 82 ]. The use of 2 different\\nviral vectors will help to overcome any prior anti-\\nadenovirus immunity in the body that may destroy\\nthe vector of the second dose [ 83 ].\\nPhase 1/2 clinical trials were conducted to assess\\nsafety and immunogenicity of two formulations (fro-\\nzen and lyophilized) of this vaccine on 76 healthy\\nadult volunteers aged between 18 and 60 years [ 76 ].\\nIn Phase 1, participants received a single intramuscular\\ndose of rAd26-S or rAd5-S on day 0 [ 76 ]. However, in\\nphase 2, which began no earlier than 5 days after the\\nphase 1 vaccination, participants were administrated a\\nsingle intramuscular dose of rAD26-S on day 0 fol-\\nlowed by another dose of rAD5-S on day 21 [ 76 ].\\nPreliminary data from the phase 1 trials show that no\\nsevere adverse reactions were detected in participants\\nafter vaccination [ 76 ]. Also, the frozen formulation was\\nfound to be induce a higher IgG titre (14.703 versus\\n11.143) and neutralizing antibodies (49.25 versus\\n45.95) while eliciting higher CD4 (2.5 versus 1.3) and\\nCD8 (1.3 versus 1.1) T cell proliferation rates as com-\\npared to the lyophilized formulation indicating the fro-\\nzen formulation to be more effective than the\\nlyophilized one [ 76 ].\\nPhase 3 clinical trials were performed on a larger\\nscale (nearly 22,000 adults aged at least 18 years) [ 84 ].\\nParticipants received 2 doses of the vaccine (dose 1\\nrAD26-S and dose 2 rAD5-S) or a placebo, 21 days apart\\n[ 84 ]. Results of this phase showed that the vaccine effi-\\ncacy was estimated at 91.6%. In addition, 94% of the\\nparticipants presented mild adverse reactions, while a\\nminority (less than 0.5%) exhibited severe adverse events\\n[ 84 ]. Though four deaths were reported among partici-\\npants, the cause of death was linked to the vaccine but\\nrather to severe comorbidities [ 84 ]. Interestingly, a recent\\nstudy showed that sera from a donor vaccinated with\\nGam-COVID-Vac efficiently neutralized the spike protein\\nfrom B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains [ 85 ].

This data suggest\\nthat this vaccine may offer protection against different\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants.\\n3.2.3. mRNA vaccines\\nSince more than a decade, mRNA based therapeutics\\nhave raised major interest in cancer and infectious dis-\\neases likewise [ 86 ]. Particularly, immunization through\\n\\nmRNA vaccines was found to be effective against sev-\\neral viral infections. It has been reported that mRNA\\nvaccines are able to induce potent innate and adap-\\ntive immune reactions against Rabies, Zika and\\nInfluenza A infections in animal models and in humans\\n– [ 87 90 ]. Therefore, it is not surprising that mRNA vac-\\ncines have now emerged as an effective preventive\\nstrategy against SARS-CoV-2 infections. This technol-\\nogy is based on the principle that mRNA is an inter-\\nmediate messenger that can be easily delivered into\\nhost cells and translated into antigen of interest that\\nwill trigger a protective antigen-specific immune\\nresponse in the human body. Within a year from the\\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA vaccines,\\nnamely, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273\\n(Moderna biotechnologies Inc.) were approved by the\\nFDA for emergency use as a prevention against SARS-\\nCoV-2 infection.\\nBoth vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, carry a\\nnucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the\\nfull-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) stabilized in\\nthe pre-fusion conformation and formulated in lipid\\nnanoparticles (LNPs). These LNPs form a solid lipid\\ncomplex that encapsulate and stabilize the mRNA and\\npromotes its intracellular uptake [ 88 , 91 ]. While both\\nvaccines are administered intramuscularly in two\\nshots, the second dose is administered after 21 days\\nfor BNT162b2 and 28 days for mRNA-1273.\\nPhase III clinical trials have demonstrated that\\nBNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines have exhibited\\nmore than 90% protection efficacy in people with no\\n– prior known infection [ 92 95 ]. In fact, Polack et al.\\ndemonstrated that the BNT162b2 vaccine conferred\\n95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years\\nof age and older, with only mild adverse effects that\\nwere similar to those observed with other known viral\\nvaccines (short-term fatigue, headache, mild-to-moder-\\nate pain at the injection site) [ 93 ]. Moreover, the COVE\\nstudy group in the USA has reported that the mRNA-\\n1273 vaccine has presented 94.1% efficacy in prevent-\\ning COVID-19 illness with no patterns of safety con-\\ncerns [ 92 ]. In another recent study, Thompson et al.\\nhave shown that, for both mRNA vaccines, full immun-\\nization with 2 doses of vaccine provides 90% effective-\\n\\u0006 ness against COVID-19 at 14 days following the\\nsecond dose [ 96 ]. However, while the mRNA-1273 vac-\\ncine is only approved for use in people aged 18 years\\nand older, the BNT162b2 vaccine has been recently\\ngranted authorization by the FDA to be used in ado-\\nlescents aged 12 to 15 years old [ 97 ]. Moreover, recent\\nstudies have reported that the BNT162b2 vaccine pro-\\n\\u0006 vides strong protection ( 95%) against the COVID-19\\n\n```",

This data suggest\\nthat this vaccine may offer protection against different\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants.\\n3.2.3. mRNA vaccines\\nSince more than a decade, mRNA based therapeutics\\nhave raised major interest in cancer and infectious dis-\\neases likewise [ 86 ]. Particularly, immunization through\\n\\nmRNA vaccines was found to be effective against sev-\\neral viral infections. It has been reported that mRNA\\nvaccines are able to induce potent innate and adap-\\ntive immune reactions against Rabies, Zika and\\nInfluenza A infections in animal models and in humans\\n– [ 87 90 ]. Therefore, it is not surprising that mRNA vac-\\ncines have now emerged as an effective preventive\\nstrategy against SARS-CoV-2 infections. This technol-\\nogy is based on the principle that mRNA is an inter-\\nmediate messenger that can be easily delivered into\\nhost cells and translated into antigen of interest that\\nwill trigger a protective antigen-specific immune\\nresponse in the human body. Within a year from the\\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA vaccines,\\nnamely, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273\\n(Moderna biotechnologies Inc.) were approved by the\\nFDA for emergency use as a prevention against SARS-\\nCoV-2 infection.\\nBoth vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, carry a\\nnucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the\\nfull-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) stabilized in\\nthe pre-fusion conformation and formulated in lipid\\nnanoparticles (LNPs). These LNPs form a solid lipid\\ncomplex that encapsulate and stabilize the mRNA and\\npromotes its intracellular uptake [ 88 , 91 ]. While both\\nvaccines are administered intramuscularly in two\\nshots, the second dose is administered after 21 days\\nfor BNT162b2 and 28 days for mRNA-1273.\\nPhase III clinical trials have demonstrated that\\nBNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines have exhibited\\nmore than 90% protection efficacy in people with no\\n– prior known infection [ 92 95 ]. In fact, Polack et al.\\ndemonstrated that the BNT162b2 vaccine conferred\\n95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years\\nof age and older, with only mild adverse effects that\\nwere similar to those observed with other known viral\\nvaccines (short-term fatigue, headache, mild-to-moder-\\nate pain at the injection site) [ 93 ]. Moreover, the COVE\\nstudy group in the USA has reported that the mRNA-\\n1273 vaccine has presented 94.1% efficacy in prevent-\\ning COVID-19 illness with no patterns of safety con-\\ncerns [ 92 ]. In another recent study, Thompson et al.\\nhave shown that, for both mRNA vaccines, full immun-\\nization with 2 doses of vaccine provides 90% effective-\\n\\u0006 ness against COVID-19 at 14 days following the\\nsecond dose [ 96 ]. However, while the mRNA-1273 vac-\\ncine is only approved for use in people aged 18 years\\nand older, the BNT162b2 vaccine has been recently\\ngranted authorization by the FDA to be used in ado-\\nlescents aged 12 to 15 years old [ 97 ].

Moreover, recent\\nstudies have reported that the BNT162b2 vaccine pro-\\n\\u0006 vides strong protection ( 95%) against the COVID-19\\n\\n--- Page 10 ---\\nvariants detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and\\nSouth Africa (B.1.351) [ 98 , 99 ]. Interestingly, a pre-print\\nreport has revealed that the effectiveness of\\nBNT162b2 was reduced to 87.9% with the B.1.617.2\\nCOVID-19 variant that has lately emerged in India\\n[ 100 ]. As for the mRNA-1273 vaccine, further studies\\nare needed to confirm its effectiveness against the\\nemerging COVID-19 variants.\\nEvidently, the immunogenic potential of COVID-19\\nmRNA vaccines have already been documented\\nthrough various preclinical and clinical trials\\n[ 89 , 92 , 93 , 101 ]. Interestingly, a phase I clinical trial on\\n47 participants demonstrated that the mRNA-1273\\ninduces a robust immune response which was time\\nand dose-dependent [ 101 ]. Additionally, while CD4 T\\ncells expression was upregulated in response to the\\nvaccination, only low level of CD8 T cells were\\ndetected at the highest tested concentration and after\\nthe second vaccination dose [ 101 ]. Moreover, another\\nstudy showed that BNT162b2 induces a broad\\nimmune response with SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific neu-\\nþ þ tralizing antibodies and poly-specific CD4 and CD8\\nT cells [ 102 ]. Interestingly, the same study has\\nreported a strong memory T cell response up to nine\\nweeks after the booster dose [ 102 ].\\nApparently, in comparison to other approved vac-\\ncines platforms, mRNA-based vaccines have several\\nadvantages. For example, in the situation of a wide-\\nspread global pandemic such as COVID-19, mRNA vac-\\ncine production is rapid and can be manufactured on\\nlarger scales at relatively lower costs. Moreover, mRNA\\nvaccines are considered safe since they do not contain\\nthe full pathogen (unlike vaccines integrating live-vec-\\ntors or inactivated viruses), and do not carry the viral\\nDNA material that might be associated to genotoxic\\nconcerns (like DNA-based vaccines) [ 88 , 103 ].\\nHowever, the major problem with mRNA vaccines is\\nthe stability of the formulation since they require a\\nstrict temperature control for shipment and storage to\\navoid the degradation of the mRNA. Moreover, the\\ninduced activation of the immune system would\\npotentially lead to side effects associated with\\nenhanced inflammatory processes. Therefore, although\\nmRNA vaccines project a powerful strategy to contain\\nthe COVID-19 outbreak, more studies are needed to\\nconfirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of\\nthese vaccines.\\n3.2.4. Whole virus vaccines\\nHistorically, whole viral inactivation is one of the old-\\nest strategies that have been successfully used to pro-\\nduce vaccines to prevent/treat a variety of viral\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 533\\ndiseases including influenza, poliomyelitis and human\\n– papillomavirus infections [ 104 106 ]. In comparison to\\nother whole pathogen-containing vaccines, such as\\nlive attenuated virus vaccines, the use of inactivated\\nvirus vaccines pose fewer safety concerns, since the\\npathogen cannot revert to its original state and cause\\ndiseases\n```",

Moreover, recent\\nstudies have reported that the BNT162b2 vaccine pro-\\n\\u0006 vides strong protection ( 95%) against the COVID-19\\n\\n--- Page 10 ---\\nvariants detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and\\nSouth Africa (B.1.351) [ 98 , 99 ]. Interestingly, a pre-print\\nreport has revealed that the effectiveness of\\nBNT162b2 was reduced to 87.9% with the B.1.617.2\\nCOVID-19 variant that has lately emerged in India\\n[ 100 ]. As for the mRNA-1273 vaccine, further studies\\nare needed to confirm its effectiveness against the\\nemerging COVID-19 variants.\\nEvidently, the immunogenic potential of COVID-19\\nmRNA vaccines have already been documented\\nthrough various preclinical and clinical trials\\n[ 89 , 92 , 93 , 101 ]. Interestingly, a phase I clinical trial on\\n47 participants demonstrated that the mRNA-1273\\ninduces a robust immune response which was time\\nand dose-dependent [ 101 ]. Additionally, while CD4 T\\ncells expression was upregulated in response to the\\nvaccination, only low level of CD8 T cells were\\ndetected at the highest tested concentration and after\\nthe second vaccination dose [ 101 ]. Moreover, another\\nstudy showed that BNT162b2 induces a broad\\nimmune response with SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific neu-\\nþ þ tralizing antibodies and poly-specific CD4 and CD8\\nT cells [ 102 ]. Interestingly, the same study has\\nreported a strong memory T cell response up to nine\\nweeks after the booster dose [ 102 ].\\nApparently, in comparison to other approved vac-\\ncines platforms, mRNA-based vaccines have several\\nadvantages. For example, in the situation of a wide-\\nspread global pandemic such as COVID-19, mRNA vac-\\ncine production is rapid and can be manufactured on\\nlarger scales at relatively lower costs. Moreover, mRNA\\nvaccines are considered safe since they do not contain\\nthe full pathogen (unlike vaccines integrating live-vec-\\ntors or inactivated viruses), and do not carry the viral\\nDNA material that might be associated to genotoxic\\nconcerns (like DNA-based vaccines) [ 88 , 103 ].\\nHowever, the major problem with mRNA vaccines is\\nthe stability of the formulation since they require a\\nstrict temperature control for shipment and storage to\\navoid the degradation of the mRNA. Moreover, the\\ninduced activation of the immune system would\\npotentially lead to side effects associated with\\nenhanced inflammatory processes. Therefore, although\\nmRNA vaccines project a powerful strategy to contain\\nthe COVID-19 outbreak, more studies are needed to\\nconfirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of\\nthese vaccines.\\n3.2.4. Whole virus vaccines\\nHistorically, whole viral inactivation is one of the old-\\nest strategies that have been successfully used to pro-\\nduce vaccines to prevent/treat a variety of viral\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 533\\ndiseases including influenza, poliomyelitis and human\\n– papillomavirus infections [ 104 106 ]. In comparison to\\nother whole pathogen-containing vaccines, such as\\nlive attenuated virus vaccines, the use of inactivated\\nvirus vaccines pose fewer safety concerns, since the\\npathogen cannot revert to its original state and cause\\ndiseases\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

FERNANDES ET AL.\\nPhilippines, Hong Kong, and Chile. Furthermore,\\ntwo randomized double-blinded placebo control stud-\\nies have been performed in Brazil and Turkey to deter-\\nmine the efficacy of the vaccine. These trials\\ndemonstrated that the COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell)\\nInactivated efficacy rate for COVID-19 prevention was\\nup to 53% in Brazil and 83% in Turkey [ 113 , 114 ]. In\\naddition, these studies also report that vaccination\\nwith COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated induces\\na humoral response 28 days post-vaccination i.e. 97%\\nneutralizing antibodies against SARS-COV-2 and 99%\\nagainst RBD-IgG [ 111 , 112 ]. Although only a small num-\\nber of studies have been published for the COVID-19\\nVaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated vaccine, very few cases\\nof hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions\\n(0.009%) have been reported [ 115 , 116 ].\\n3.2.4.2. Covilo; BIBP-CorV. Covilo; BIBP-CorV\\n(Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine) is one of two inac-\\ntivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by\\nSinopharm. Few studies have investigated the\\nimmunogenicity and efficacy of BBIBP-CorV. The first\\nstudy on BBIBP-CorV has showed that the vaccine\\ninduces high levels of neutralizing antibodies in six\\nmammalian species including mice, rats, guinea pigs,\\nrabbits, and non- human primates (cynomolgus mon-\\nkeys and rhesus macaques). Interestingly, this study\\nreported that two doses of immunization of BBIBP-\\nCorV at 2 mg/dose, is able to provide high protection\\nagainst SARS- CoV-2 without detectable antibody\\ndependent enhancement of infection [ 117 ].

Challenges\\nSince the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, its invasive\\nproperties have not yet been well studied or under-\\nstood. However, some studies have highlighted a new\\npotential threat in the form of identifying the possible\\nneuro-invasive properties of the novel virus. For\\nexample, although the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are\\nboth known to enter and infect host cells through\\nACE2 expressed in the lung cells; according to some\\nstudies, ACE2 is not the only receptor that makes host\\ncells susceptible to viral infection. For example, human\\nendothelial and intestinal cells that express ACE2\\nin vivo failed to be infected by SARS-CoV [ 135 , 136 ] On\\nthe other hand, cells with comparatively undetectable\\nlevels of ACE2 (like hepatocytes) were found to be\\ninfected by SARS-CoV [ 137 ]. Likewise, SARS-CoV and\\nMERS-CoV are known to enter the central nervous sys-\\ntem where the ACE2 and DDP430 receptors are very\\nlow [ 138 ]. Similarly, studies on patients have shown\\nthe presence of SARS-CoV particles in the brain of\\ninfected individuals thus supporting the neuro-invasive\\n– potential of this virus [ 139 141 ]. Since SARS-CoV and\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 are like each other, it is possible that\\nthe latter may also possess such a neuro-invasive\\npotential. Furthermore, in the case of COVID-19, the\\nlatency period may be sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 to\\ninvade the CNS and destroy the medullary neurons\\n[ 138 ]. In support of this theory, some studies\\n[ 4 , 142 , 143 ] have reported that a few of the COVID-19\\npatients did have mild neurologic symptoms like\\nheadaches and nausea, while another recent study\\nreported that an estimated 88% of severe COVID-19\\ncases displayed neurologic manifestations such as\\nacute cerebrovascular disease and impaired conscious-\\nness [ 144 ].\\nThe rapidly mutating virus has also emerged as a\\nmatter of great concern. There is sufficient evidence to\\nstate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is capable of rapidly\\nevolving to invade human immune responses as well as\\ngaining the ability to adapt to other hosts in the near\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 535\\nfuture [ 145 ]. Therefore, close monitoring of the novel\\ncoronavirus is essential to keep the pandemic in check.\\nFinally, the greatest challenge of the current\\nCOVID-19 pandemic is the transmission of the virus to\\nhealthcare workers. Studies report that although strin-\\ngent isolation and quarantine measures are ensured at\\nmedical facilities, yet human-to-human transmission of\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 is highly common [ 146 , 147 ].\\nAccording to recent reports, nearly 41% of the\\npatients were found to be infected in hospital settings,\\nout of which 29% were medical staff [ 148 ]. Such trans-\\nmission in healthcare settings poses a very serious\\nthreat and requires rigorous monitoring.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has unques-\\ntionably raised a major public health emergency all\\nover the world. The threatening concern is attributed\\nto the transmissibility of the virus and its capacity to\\nrapidly evolve and mutate leading to the emergence\\nof new uncommon strains.\\nThe leap in advancement of better diagnosis, tar-\\ngeted vaccines and therapeutic remedies is sound evi-\\ndence that scientific understanding, research, and\\ntechnology is evolving at the pace of the pandemic.\\nEvidently, continued, and consistent research is\\nrequired to improve our knowledge of key aspects\n```",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks the performance of major technology stocks and experienced a 3.4% decline today.\nentity<|#|>Nexon Technologies<|#|>organization<|#|>Nexon Technologies is a tech company that saw its stock decline by 7.8% after disappointing earnings.\nentity<|#|>Omega Energy<|#|>organization<|#|>Omega Energy is an energy company that gained 2.1% in stock value due to rising oil prices.\nentity<|#|>Gold Futures<|#|>product<|#|>Gold futures rose by 1.5%, indicating increased investor interest in safe-haven assets.\nentity<|#|>Crude Oil<|#|>product<|#|>Crude oil prices rose to $87.60 per barrel due to supply constraints and strong demand.\nentity<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>category<|#|>Market selloff refers to the significant decline in stock values due to investor concerns over interest rates and regulations.\nentity<|#|>Federal Reserve Policy Announcement<|#|>category<|#|>The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy announcement is expected to impact investor confidence and market stability.\nentity<|#|>3.4% Decline<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index experienced a 3.4% decline in midday trading.\nrelation<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>market performance, investor sentiment<|#|>The decline in the Global Tech Index is part of the broader market selloff driven by investor concerns.\nrelation<|#|>Nexon Technologies<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>company impact, index movement<|#|>Nexon Technologies' stock decline contributed to the overall drop in the Global Tech Index.\nrelation<|#|>Gold Futures<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>market reaction, safe-haven investment<|#|>Gold prices rose as investors sought safe-haven assets during the market selloff.\nrelation<|#|>Federal Reserve Policy Announcement<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>interest rate impact, financial regulation<|#|>Speculation over Federal Reserve policy changes contributed to market volatility and investor selloff.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nAt the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, Noah Carter broke the 100m sprint record using cutting-edge carbon-fiber spikes.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>event<|#|>The World Athletics Championship is a global sports competition featuring top athletes in track and field.\nentity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the host city of the World Athletics Championship.\nentity<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>person<|#|>Noah Carter is a sprinter who set a new record in the 100m sprint at the World Athletics Championship.\nentity<|#|>100m Sprint Record<|#|>category<|#|>The 100m sprint record is a benchmark in athletics, recently broken by Noah Carter.\nentity<|#|>Carbon-Fiber Spikes<|#|>equipment<|#|>Carbon-fiber spikes are advanced sprinting shoes that provide enhanced speed and traction.\nentity<|#|>World Athletics Federation<|#|>organization<|#|>The World Athletics Federation is the governing body overseeing the World Athletics Championship and record validations.\nrelation<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>event location, international competition<|#|>The World Athletics Championship is being hosted in Tokyo.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>100m Sprint Record<|#|>athlete achievement, record-breaking<|#|>Noah Carter set a new 100m sprint record at the championship.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>Carbon-Fiber Spikes<|#|>athletic equipment, performance boost<|#|>Noah Carter used carbon-fiber spikes to enhance performance during the race.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>athlete participation, competition<|#|>Noah Carter is competing at the World Athletics Championship.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n\n---Real Data to be Processed---\n<Input>\nEntity_types: [Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject]\nText:\n```\nthe world.

Furthermore,\\ntwo randomized double-blinded placebo control stud-\\nies have been performed in Brazil and Turkey to deter-\\nmine the efficacy of the vaccine. These trials\\ndemonstrated that the COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell)\\nInactivated efficacy rate for COVID-19 prevention was\\nup to 53% in Brazil and 83% in Turkey [ 113 , 114 ]. In\\naddition, these studies also report that vaccination\\nwith COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated induces\\na humoral response 28 days post-vaccination i.e. 97%\\nneutralizing antibodies against SARS-COV-2 and 99%\\nagainst RBD-IgG [ 111 , 112 ]. Although only a small num-\\nber of studies have been published for the COVID-19\\nVaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated vaccine, very few cases\\nof hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions\\n(0.009%) have been reported [ 115 , 116 ].\\n3.2.4.2. Covilo; BIBP-CorV. Covilo; BIBP-CorV\\n(Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine) is one of two inac-\\ntivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by\\nSinopharm. Few studies have investigated the\\nimmunogenicity and efficacy of BBIBP-CorV. The first\\nstudy on BBIBP-CorV has showed that the vaccine\\ninduces high levels of neutralizing antibodies in six\\nmammalian species including mice, rats, guinea pigs,\\nrabbits, and non- human primates (cynomolgus mon-\\nkeys and rhesus macaques). Interestingly, this study\\nreported that two doses of immunization of BBIBP-\\nCorV at 2 mg/dose, is able to provide high protection\\nagainst SARS- CoV-2 without detectable antibody\\ndependent enhancement of infection [ 117 ]. In add-\\nition, all macaques in the low and high dose groups\\ndid not show a detectable viral load in any lung lobe\\nat 7 days after inoculation of BBIBP-CorV. Also in com-\\nparison to the AZD1222 vaccine, both vaccines were\\nfound to confer effective protection by preventing the\\ndevelopment of viral interstitial pneumonia in all vac-\\ncinated macaques [ 118 ].\\nPhase I (192 adults) and phase II (448 adults) clin-\\nical trials for the BBIBP-CorV vaccine, have shown that\\nthe vaccine is safe and well tolerated at all tested\\ndoses. Antibodies were elicited against SARS-\\nCoV-2 in all vaccine recipients at 42days after the\\nsecond dose. These trials included individuals older than\\n60 that showed significantly high neutralizing antibody\\ntitres [ 119 ]. Moreover, a particular report also stated that\\nthe vaccine had a low rate of adverse reactions and\\nshowed high immunogenicity. Yet, however, long-term\\nassessment of safety and efficacy would require phase III\\ntrials [ 120 ]. The first peer- reviewed data obtained in\\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain showed that\\nBBIBP-CorV is 78.1% effective against symptomatic cases\\n\\nand 100% effective against severe cases [ 121 ]. In add-\\nition, UAE previously announced interim results showing\\nthat the vaccine provided 86% efficacy [ 122 ].\\nAdditionally, Sinopharm has started a phase III trial in\\nseveral countries in Africa [ 123 , 124 ], Asia and Europe\\n[ 125 ].

In add-\\nition, UAE previously announced interim results showing\\nthat the vaccine provided 86% efficacy [ 122 ].\\nAdditionally, Sinopharm has started a phase III trial in\\nseveral countries in Africa [ 123 , 124 ], Asia and Europe\\n[ 125 ]. Reports from a randomized, double blind, placebo\\nparallel-controlled phase III clinical trial in Argentina\\nshowed that the vaccine portrayed a lower effectiveness\\n(79%) as compared to other approved COVID-19 mRNA\\nvaccines. However, this vaccine has an advantage stor-\\nage and shipment protocols at regular refrigeration\\ntemperatures.\\n3.2.5. Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines on the emerg-\\ning VOCs\\nGiven the alarming frequency of the emergence of\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants, the efficacy of the existing vac-\\ncines remains in question. In the light of this, it may\\nbe encouraging to state that in addition to the gen-\\neral public, even patients with co-morbidities like can-\\ncer and other immuno-compromised individuals like\\nsolid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) have also\\nshown the development of neutralizing antibodies\\nupon vaccination with most conventional vaccines, as\\ndiscussed in the following reports. According to cer-\\ntain studies, SOTRs may be more commonly associated\\nwith breakthrough disease despite being fully vacci-\\nnated as compared to the general population\\n[ 126 , 127 ]. Other studies have also reported that most\\nSORTs often develop weak antibody responses against\\n– SARS-CoV-2 m-RNA vaccines [ 128 130 ]. However,\\naccording to another subsequent study even such vul-\\nnerable populations are reported to show an increase\\nin neutralizing antibodies against novel VOCs after the\\nthird dose of a\\nSARS-CoV-2 vaccine [ 131 ]. In addition, the CAPTURE\\nstudy also reported the presence of neutralizing anti-\\nbodies against the novel COVID-19 VOCs in patients\\nwith both solid and hematological cancers, upon\\nimmunization with the BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccine.\\nAlthough these studies report that the vaccination-\\ndependent stimulation of an immune response against\\nthe novel VOCs in such vulnerable populations is\\nmuch lowered as compared to normal healthy individ-\\nuals; yet these results are indeed promising and prove\\nthe potency of the currently available vaccines to\\ncombat the existing and emerging VOCs.\\nIn addition, the utilization of computational\\napproaches to predict the impact of the VOCs on the\\nvaccines has also proven useful. For example, certain\\ncomputational approaches like epitope prediction that\\nenables the identification of structural vaccinology\\n\\n--- Page 12 ---\\ntargets may also help in modelling the effects of the\\nmutations in the spike proteins observed in the\\nemerging VOCs [ 132 , 133 ]. Moreover, another study\\nhas also provided a reliable model for epitope loss in\\nVOCs and their predicted escape from vaccine-\\ninduced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [ 134 ]. Such computa-\\ntional approaches prove to be highly useful in foresee-\\ning the impact of the emerging VOCs on the efficacy\\nof COVID-19 vaccines.\\n4. Challenges\\nSince the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, its invasive\\nproperties have not yet been well studied or under-\\nstood. However, some studies have highlighted a new\\npotential threat in the form of identifying the possible\\nneuro-invasive properties of the novel virus. For\\nexample, although the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are\\nboth known to enter and infect host\n```",

In add-\\nition, UAE previously announced interim results showing\\nthat the vaccine provided 86% efficacy [ 122 ].\\nAdditionally, Sinopharm has started a phase III trial in\\nseveral countries in Africa [ 123 , 124 ], Asia and Europe\\n[ 125 ]. Reports from a randomized, double blind, placebo\\nparallel-controlled phase III clinical trial in Argentina\\nshowed that the vaccine portrayed a lower effectiveness\\n(79%) as compared to other approved COVID-19 mRNA\\nvaccines. However, this vaccine has an advantage stor-\\nage and shipment protocols at regular refrigeration\\ntemperatures.\\n3.2.5. Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines on the emerg-\\ning VOCs\\nGiven the alarming frequency of the emergence of\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants, the efficacy of the existing vac-\\ncines remains in question. In the light of this, it may\\nbe encouraging to state that in addition to the gen-\\neral public, even patients with co-morbidities like can-\\ncer and other immuno-compromised individuals like\\nsolid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) have also\\nshown the development of neutralizing antibodies\\nupon vaccination with most conventional vaccines, as\\ndiscussed in the following reports. According to cer-\\ntain studies, SOTRs may be more commonly associated\\nwith breakthrough disease despite being fully vacci-\\nnated as compared to the general population\\n[ 126 , 127 ]. Other studies have also reported that most\\nSORTs often develop weak antibody responses against\\n– SARS-CoV-2 m-RNA vaccines [ 128 130 ]. However,\\naccording to another subsequent study even such vul-\\nnerable populations are reported to show an increase\\nin neutralizing antibodies against novel VOCs after the\\nthird dose of a\\nSARS-CoV-2 vaccine [ 131 ]. In addition, the CAPTURE\\nstudy also reported the presence of neutralizing anti-\\nbodies against the novel COVID-19 VOCs in patients\\nwith both solid and hematological cancers, upon\\nimmunization with the BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccine.\\nAlthough these studies report that the vaccination-\\ndependent stimulation of an immune response against\\nthe novel VOCs in such vulnerable populations is\\nmuch lowered as compared to normal healthy individ-\\nuals; yet these results are indeed promising and prove\\nthe potency of the currently available vaccines to\\ncombat the existing and emerging VOCs.\\nIn addition, the utilization of computational\\napproaches to predict the impact of the VOCs on the\\nvaccines has also proven useful. For example, certain\\ncomputational approaches like epitope prediction that\\nenables the identification of structural vaccinology\\n\\n--- Page 12 ---\\ntargets may also help in modelling the effects of the\\nmutations in the spike proteins observed in the\\nemerging VOCs [ 132 , 133 ]. Moreover, another study\\nhas also provided a reliable model for epitope loss in\\nVOCs and their predicted escape from vaccine-\\ninduced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [ 134 ]. Such computa-\\ntional approaches prove to be highly useful in foresee-\\ning the impact of the emerging VOCs on the efficacy\\nof COVID-19 vaccines.\\n4. Challenges\\nSince the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, its invasive\\nproperties have not yet been well studied or under-\\nstood. However, some studies have highlighted a new\\npotential threat in the form of identifying the possible\\nneuro-invasive properties of the novel virus.

Challenges\\nSince the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, its invasive\\nproperties have not yet been well studied or under-\\nstood. However, some studies have highlighted a new\\npotential threat in the form of identifying the possible\\nneuro-invasive properties of the novel virus. For\\nexample, although the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are\\nboth known to enter and infect host cells through\\nACE2 expressed in the lung cells; according to some\\nstudies, ACE2 is not the only receptor that makes host\\ncells susceptible to viral infection. For example, human\\nendothelial and intestinal cells that express ACE2\\nin vivo failed to be infected by SARS-CoV [ 135 , 136 ] On\\nthe other hand, cells with comparatively undetectable\\nlevels of ACE2 (like hepatocytes) were found to be\\ninfected by SARS-CoV [ 137 ]. Likewise, SARS-CoV and\\nMERS-CoV are known to enter the central nervous sys-\\ntem where the ACE2 and DDP430 receptors are very\\nlow [ 138 ]. Similarly, studies on patients have shown\\nthe presence of SARS-CoV particles in the brain of\\ninfected individuals thus supporting the neuro-invasive\\n– potential of this virus [ 139 141 ]. Since SARS-CoV and\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 are like each other, it is possible that\\nthe latter may also possess such a neuro-invasive\\npotential. Furthermore, in the case of COVID-19, the\\nlatency period may be sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 to\\ninvade the CNS and destroy the medullary neurons\\n[ 138 ]. In support of this theory, some studies\\n[ 4 , 142 , 143 ] have reported that a few of the COVID-19\\npatients did have mild neurologic symptoms like\\nheadaches and nausea, while another recent study\\nreported that an estimated 88% of severe COVID-19\\ncases displayed neurologic manifestations such as\\nacute cerebrovascular disease and impaired conscious-\\nness [ 144 ].\\nThe rapidly mutating virus has also emerged as a\\nmatter of great concern. There is sufficient evidence to\\nstate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is capable of rapidly\\nevolving to invade human immune responses as well as\\ngaining the ability to adapt to other hosts in the near\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 535\\nfuture [ 145 ]. Therefore, close monitoring of the novel\\ncoronavirus is essential to keep the pandemic in check.\\nFinally, the greatest challenge of the current\\nCOVID-19 pandemic is the transmission of the virus to\\nhealthcare workers. Studies report that although strin-\\ngent isolation and quarantine measures are ensured at\\nmedical facilities, yet human-to-human transmission of\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 is highly common [ 146 , 147 ].\\nAccording to recent reports, nearly 41% of the\\npatients were found to be infected in hospital settings,\\nout of which 29% were medical staff [ 148 ]. Such trans-\\nmission in healthcare settings poses a very serious\\nthreat and requires rigorous monitoring.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has unques-\\ntionably raised a major public health emergency all\\nover the world. The threatening concern is attributed\\nto the transmissibility of the virus and its capacity to\\nrapidly evolve and mutate leading to the emergence\\nof new uncommon strains.\\nThe leap in advancement of better diagnosis, tar-\\ngeted vaccines and therapeutic remedies is sound evi-\\ndence that scientific understanding, research, and\\ntechnology is evolving at the pace of the pandemic.\\nEvidently, continued, and consistent research is\\nrequired to improve our knowledge of key aspects\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Alex<|#|>person<|#|>Alex is a character who experiences frustration and is observant of the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>Taylor<|#|>person<|#|>Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty and shows a moment of reverence towards a device, indicating a change in perspective.\nentity<|#|>Jordan<|#|>person<|#|>Jordan shares a commitment to discovery and has a significant interaction with Taylor regarding a device.\nentity<|#|>Cruz<|#|>person<|#|>Cruz is associated with a vision of control and order, influencing the dynamics among other characters.\nentity<|#|>The Device<|#|>equipment<|#|>The Device is central to the story, with potential game-changing implications, and is revered by Taylor.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Taylor<|#|>power dynamics, observation<|#|>Alex observes Taylor's authoritarian behavior and notes changes in Taylor's attitude toward the device.\nrelation<|#|>Alex<|#|>Jordan<|#|>shared goals, rebellion<|#|>Alex and Jordan share a commitment to discovery, which contrasts with Cruz's vision.)\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>Jordan<|#|>conflict resolution, mutual respect<|#|>Taylor and Jordan interact directly regarding the device, leading to a moment of mutual respect and an uneasy truce.\nrelation<|#|>Jordan<|#|>Cruz<|#|>ideological conflict, rebellion<|#|>Jordan's commitment to discovery is in rebellion against Cruz's vision of control and order.\nrelation<|#|>Taylor<|#|>The Device<|#|>reverence, technological significance<|#|>Taylor shows reverence towards the device, indicating its importance and potential impact.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nStock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks the performance of major technology stocks and experienced a 3.4% decline today.\nentity<|#|>Nexon Technologies<|#|>organization<|#|>Nexon Technologies is a tech company that saw its stock decline by 7.8% after disappointing earnings.\nentity<|#|>Omega Energy<|#|>organization<|#|>Omega Energy is an energy company that gained 2.1% in stock value due to rising oil prices.\nentity<|#|>Gold Futures<|#|>product<|#|>Gold futures rose by 1.5%, indicating increased investor interest in safe-haven assets.\nentity<|#|>Crude Oil<|#|>product<|#|>Crude oil prices rose to $87.60 per barrel due to supply constraints and strong demand.\nentity<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>category<|#|>Market selloff refers to the significant decline in stock values due to investor concerns over interest rates and regulations.\nentity<|#|>Federal Reserve Policy Announcement<|#|>category<|#|>The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy announcement is expected to impact investor confidence and market stability.\nentity<|#|>3.4% Decline<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index experienced a 3.4% decline in midday trading.\nrelation<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>market performance, investor sentiment<|#|>The decline in the Global Tech Index is part of the broader market selloff driven by investor concerns.\nrelation<|#|>Nexon Technologies<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>company impact, index movement<|#|>Nexon Technologies' stock decline contributed to the overall drop in the Global Tech Index.\nrelation<|#|>Gold Futures<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>market reaction, safe-haven investment<|#|>Gold prices rose as investors sought safe-haven assets during the market selloff.\nrelation<|#|>Federal Reserve Policy Announcement<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>interest rate impact, financial regulation<|#|>Speculation over Federal Reserve policy changes contributed to market volatility and investor selloff.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nAt the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, Noah Carter broke the 100m sprint record using cutting-edge carbon-fiber spikes.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>event<|#|>The World Athletics Championship is a global sports competition featuring top athletes in track and field.\nentity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the host city of the World Athletics Championship.\nentity<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>person<|#|>Noah Carter is a sprinter who set a new record in the 100m sprint at the World Athletics Championship.\nentity<|#|>100m Sprint Record<|#|>category<|#|>The 100m sprint record is a benchmark in athletics, recently broken by Noah Carter.\nentity<|#|>Carbon-Fiber Spikes<|#|>equipment<|#|>Carbon-fiber spikes are advanced sprinting shoes that provide enhanced speed and traction.\nentity<|#|>World Athletics Federation<|#|>organization<|#|>The World Athletics Federation is the governing body overseeing the World Athletics Championship and record validations.\nrelation<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>event location, international competition<|#|>The World Athletics Championship is being hosted in Tokyo.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>100m Sprint Record<|#|>athlete achievement, record-breaking<|#|>Noah Carter set a new 100m sprint record at the championship.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>Carbon-Fiber Spikes<|#|>athletic equipment, performance boost<|#|>Noah Carter used carbon-fiber spikes to enhance performance during the race.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>athlete participation, competition<|#|>Noah Carter is competing at the World Athletics Championship.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n\n---Real Data to be Processed---\n<Input>\nEntity_types: [Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject]\nText:\n```\n[7] Tyrrell DA, Bynoe ML.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

SARS-CoV-2 is a an enveloped, sin-\\ngle-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to\\nthe Betacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family\\n[ 2 , 5 , 6 ]. This family of viruses was first identified in\\n1965 by Tyrell and Bynoe and isolated and cultivated\\nfrom patients with common colds [ 7 ]. Viral structural\\nproteins such as the nucleocapsid protein (N), mem-\\nbrane glycoprotein (M), and spike glycoprotein (S) are\\nthe primary determinants of virulence and function\\n[ 8 ]. Largely like the previous zoonotic coronavirus out-\\nbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), the current SARS-\\nCoV-2 virus causes lower respiratory tract infections\\nand may lead to Acute Respiratory Distress\\nSyndromes (ARDS).\\nThe emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2\\nin the past couple of months highlights one of the pri-\\nmary challenges facing this pandemic. Accumulation\\nof mutations arising out of subsequent viral replication\\nis a natural phenomenon. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is\\nknown to evolve at a rate of approximately\\n\\u0003 \\u0004 1.1 10 3 substitutions per site per year. This figure\\n\\u0005 corresponds to nearly one substitution every 11 days\\n[ 9 ]. Although most mutations are found to have no\\nperceivable impact, few mutations were found to give\\nrise to novel high-risk variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\\n( Figure 1 ). The nomenclature and classification of\\nthese increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants has\\nbeen a challenge to the WHO. However during late\\n2020, the WHO prompted the classification of novel\\nSARS- CoV-2 strains as Variants of Interest (VOIs) and\\nVariants of Concern (VOCs) [ 10 ]. Specifically, VOIs\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 525\\ninclude variants with mutations that result in changes\\nto receptor binding, reduced efficacy of treatments,\\ndecreased neutralization by antibodies and a potential\\nincrease in disease severity and/or transmissibility [ 11 ].\\nIn addition, VOCs are defined as variants against which\\nthere may be strong evidence of an increase in trans-\\nmissibility, greater disease severity, notable reduction\\nin neutralization by antibodies generated and thus\\ndecreased response to treatments and vaccines [ 11 ].\\n( Table 1 )\\nAdditionally, in order to synchronize a universal\\nnomenclature that facilitate a streamlined tracking of\\neach of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, the WHO\\nhas recommended the use of the Greek Alphabet to\\nuniquely identify each novel variant ( Figure 1 ).\\n2. Advancements in COVID-19 detection\\n& diagnosis\\nThe emergence of novel and evolving variants of\\nSARS-CoV-2 has indeed fostered the need for change\\nin the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic\\nmethods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\\nOn the other hand, developing rapid and sensitive\\ndiagnostic technologies is now more challenging due\\nto emerging variants and varying symptoms exhibited\\nin infected\n```",

SARS-CoV-2 is a an enveloped, sin-\\ngle-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to\\nthe Betacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family\\n[ 2 , 5 , 6 ]. This family of viruses was first identified in\\n1965 by Tyrell and Bynoe and isolated and cultivated\\nfrom patients with common colds [ 7 ]. Viral structural\\nproteins such as the nucleocapsid protein (N), mem-\\nbrane glycoprotein (M), and spike glycoprotein (S) are\\nthe primary determinants of virulence and function\\n[ 8 ]. Largely like the previous zoonotic coronavirus out-\\nbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), the current SARS-\\nCoV-2 virus causes lower respiratory tract infections\\nand may lead to Acute Respiratory Distress\\nSyndromes (ARDS).\\nThe emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2\\nin the past couple of months highlights one of the pri-\\nmary challenges facing this pandemic. Accumulation\\nof mutations arising out of subsequent viral replication\\nis a natural phenomenon. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is\\nknown to evolve at a rate of approximately\\n\\u0003 \\u0004 1.1 10 3 substitutions per site per year. This figure\\n\\u0005 corresponds to nearly one substitution every 11 days\\n[ 9 ]. Although most mutations are found to have no\\nperceivable impact, few mutations were found to give\\nrise to novel high-risk variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\\n( Figure 1 ). The nomenclature and classification of\\nthese increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants has\\nbeen a challenge to the WHO. However during late\\n2020, the WHO prompted the classification of novel\\nSARS- CoV-2 strains as Variants of Interest (VOIs) and\\nVariants of Concern (VOCs) [ 10 ]. Specifically, VOIs\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 525\\ninclude variants with mutations that result in changes\\nto receptor binding, reduced efficacy of treatments,\\ndecreased neutralization by antibodies and a potential\\nincrease in disease severity and/or transmissibility [ 11 ].\\nIn addition, VOCs are defined as variants against which\\nthere may be strong evidence of an increase in trans-\\nmissibility, greater disease severity, notable reduction\\nin neutralization by antibodies generated and thus\\ndecreased response to treatments and vaccines [ 11 ].\\n( Table 1 )\\nAdditionally, in order to synchronize a universal\\nnomenclature that facilitate a streamlined tracking of\\neach of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, the WHO\\nhas recommended the use of the Greek Alphabet to\\nuniquely identify each novel variant ( Figure 1 ).\\n2.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

This assay is known to\\ntarget the E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. The CRISPR-\\nCas13 assays are known to have a sensitivity of\\ngreater than 95% and specificity of nearly 99% [ 23 ]\\nIn addition, microarray-based technology is also\\ncurrently being used to detect viral RNA. Here,\\nlabelled cDNA molecules synthesized from viral RNA\\nhybridized with solid-phase oligonucleotides on the\\nsurface of an array plate are quantified with the help\\nof a microarray plate reader [ 24 ].\\nNext-generation gene sequencing (NGS) methods\\nare also common for the detection of viral presence\\nand helps in understanding the epidemiology of\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. However, although NGS platforms\\nare accurate and reliable, their practical application is\\noften limited due the involvement of higher costs and\\nexpertise [ 13 ]. However, whole-genome sequence\\nremains to be the gold standard for the detection of\\nemerging VOCs across the globe. Apparently, since\\nthis method is more prolonged and laborious, many\\nstudies have come up with faster and similarly robust\\nPCR melting temperature assays that are largely com-\\nparable to genome sequencing [ 25 , 26 ]. Interestingly,\\nanother group has also reported the development of\\nalternate sequencing platforms based on Sangers\\nsequencing of a single PCR fragment that is capable\\nof identifying and distinguishing all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs\\nthat have been identified so far [ 27 ].\\n\\n2.2.

These\\ncommercially available kits are usually compatible with\\na variety of clinical specimens like nasopharyngeal\\nswabs, nasal swabs, and saliva and mainly detect the\\npresence of two main SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S and N\\nproteins) [ 28 ]. However, the success rate of these\\nassays is largely dependent on factors such as disease\\n– – stage and viral load (1 3 days before to 5 7 days after\\nthe onset of symptoms). To address these issues,\\nresearch on incorporating novel sensor and biosensor\\ntechnologies, to enhance the sensitivity of these anti-\\ngen-based immuno- assays is currently ongoing.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 infection\\nIn contrast with nucleic acids and antigen-based\\ndetection techniques, antibody-based techniques are\\nnot considered suitable for the early detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection. This is due to the fact that anti-\\nbody responses are often generated nearly two weeks\\npost-infection; a time-point at which viral nucleic acid\\nand antigen levels begin to decline [ 12 ]. Various bind-\\ning assays like immunofluorescence, immunochroma-\\ntographic, chemiluminescence assays and ELISA are\\nused for the detection of antibodies generated specific\\nto the SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen. Most of these kits tar-\\nget the antibodies generated against the viral S and N\\nproteins.

This assay is known to\\ntarget the E and N genes of SARS-CoV-2. The CRISPR-\\nCas13 assays are known to have a sensitivity of\\ngreater than 95% and specificity of nearly 99% [ 23 ]\\nIn addition, microarray-based technology is also\\ncurrently being used to detect viral RNA. Here,\\nlabelled cDNA molecules synthesized from viral RNA\\nhybridized with solid-phase oligonucleotides on the\\nsurface of an array plate are quantified with the help\\nof a microarray plate reader [ 24 ].\\nNext-generation gene sequencing (NGS) methods\\nare also common for the detection of viral presence\\nand helps in understanding the epidemiology of\\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. However, although NGS platforms\\nare accurate and reliable, their practical application is\\noften limited due the involvement of higher costs and\\nexpertise [ 13 ]. However, whole-genome sequence\\nremains to be the gold standard for the detection of\\nemerging VOCs across the globe. Apparently, since\\nthis method is more prolonged and laborious, many\\nstudies have come up with faster and similarly robust\\nPCR melting temperature assays that are largely com-\\nparable to genome sequencing [ 25 , 26 ]. Interestingly,\\nanother group has also reported the development of\\nalternate sequencing platforms based on Sangers\\nsequencing of a single PCR fragment that is capable\\nof identifying and distinguishing all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs\\nthat have been identified so far [ 27 ].\\n\\n2.2. SARS-CoV-2 antigen and immuno-assay-based\\ndetection of SARS-CoV-2 infection\\nAntigen-based immuno-assays such as immunofluores-\\ncent assays, immunochromatographic assays, chemilu-\\nminescent immunoassays, and Enzyme Linked\\nImmunosorbent Assays (ELISA) are also reliable meth-\\nods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These\\ncommercially available kits are usually compatible with\\na variety of clinical specimens like nasopharyngeal\\nswabs, nasal swabs, and saliva and mainly detect the\\npresence of two main SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S and N\\nproteins) [ 28 ]. However, the success rate of these\\nassays is largely dependent on factors such as disease\\n– – stage and viral load (1 3 days before to 5 7 days after\\nthe onset of symptoms). To address these issues,\\nresearch on incorporating novel sensor and biosensor\\ntechnologies, to enhance the sensitivity of these anti-\\ngen-based immuno- assays is currently ongoing. [ 13 ].\\n2.3. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 infection\\nIn contrast with nucleic acids and antigen-based\\ndetection techniques, antibody-based techniques are\\nnot considered suitable for the early detection of\\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection. This is due to the fact that anti-\\nbody responses are often generated nearly two weeks\\npost-infection; a time-point at which viral nucleic acid\\nand antigen levels begin to decline [ 12 ]. Various bind-\\ning assays like immunofluorescence, immunochroma-\\ntographic, chemiluminescence assays and ELISA are\\nused for the detection of antibodies generated specific\\nto the SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen. Most of these kits tar-\\nget the antibodies generated against the viral S and N\\nproteins. Various easy-to-use kits are now available\\nthat are based on measuring the ratio between the\\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)\\nin the\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

In add-\\nition, studies are now also developing specific primers\\nto enable the rapid detection of VOCs through real-\\ntime PCR; For example, a particular group reported\\nthe development of PCR primers for the rapid detec-\\ntion of the key mutations in the spike protein of the\\nmost recent omicron variant, thus enabling it to be\",\r\n        \"char_count\": 2583,\r\n        \"word_count\": 394,\r\n        \"extraction_method\": \"two_column\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"page_number\": 5,\r\n        \"text\": \"528 Q.

These tests\\nare claimed to be comparatively simpler and more\\nrapid than the gold standard methods of genome\\nsequencing [ 19 ]. The group also claims that these tests\\nshow a strong and reliable correlation to the results\\nobtained through genome sequencing.

Interestingly, using LAMP, expensive equipment\\nlike thermocyclers may be eliminated thereby high-\\nlighting the portability of such rapid tests. Moreover,\\nthis technique is also highly specific as it uses about\\n– 6 8 specific primer sequences to identify eight differ-\\nent regions of the target [ 13 ].

Antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs\\nCurrent treatment options for COVID-19 are apparently\\nstratified into two categories; being either antivirals or\\nimmune modifiers [ 30 ]. In the case of antiviral drugs,\\nRemdesivir has gained sufficient recognition for its\\nability to contain and manage the viral load and was\\napproved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19\\npatients with pneumonia concurrent with the shortage\\nof oxygen supply [ 30 ]. It is a broad-spectrum adeno-\\nsine nucleotide analogue and phosphoramidate pro-\\ndrug that can target a wide range of viruses includes\\ncoronaviruses. The drug mainly functions through the\\ninhibition of replication in the respiratory-associated\\nepithelial cells [ 31 ]. According to a recent report,\\nremdesivir triphosphate, being the active form of\\nRemdesivir, resembles the RNA of the coronavirus.\\nTherefore, it is easily integrated into nascent viral RNA\\nstrands resulting in halting of viral genome replication\\n[ 32 ]. In addition, another study showed that a combin-\\nation of remdesivir with baricitinib worked better in\\nreducing recovery time of hospitalized patients with\\nCOVID-19 pneumonia [ 33 ]. Baricitinib is a Janus\\n– kinase STAT signalling inhibitor (JAK-STAT) that pos-\\nsesses antiviral and anti-inflammatory action through\\nthe inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and\\ncontrols the elevation of cytokine levels. [ 34 ].\\nMoreover, certain anti-HIV drugs like lopinavir and\\nritonavir that target RNA viruses (retroviruses) were\\nreported to improve the symptoms of patients with SARS\\n[ 35 ]. Therefore, they were evaluated for their potential use\\nas a therapeutic agent against COVID-19. However,\\naccording to a certain report, no benefit was observed\\n– with lopinavir ritonavir treatment beyond standard care\\nin adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 [ 36 ].\\nSimilarly, chloroquine, a drug whose sulphate and phos-\\nphate salts have been commercialized as anti-malarial\\ndrugs was also shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2\\n– infections according to a few studies [ 37 40 ]. However, a\\nrecent trial proved that post-exposure hydroxychloro-\\nquine therapy did not prevent SARS-CoV\n```",

A recent study conducted\\non the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants proved that both\\nvariants presented a low genetic variation in the RNA\\nreplication complex and the most frequent observed\\nsubstitution was Nsp12 P323L. However, this substitu-\\ntion was not located near the polymerase active site,\\nthus did not affect the inhibition function of remdesi-\\nvir [ 49 ]. In addition, according to Lee et al. the amino\\nacid sequences of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs were\\nfound to possess numerous mutations in the spike\\nprotein, when compared to the early SARS-CoV-2\\nstrains [ 50 ].

Moreover, Showers et al. also reported\\nno difference in the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir\\nbetween early SARS-CoV-2 and these new variants\\n[ 51 ]. Furthermore, another study that analyzed the\\nprotein sequence of RdRp among SARS-CoV-2 emer-\\ngent variants show a high conservation in remdesivir-\\nbinding residues [ 52 ]. Therefore, these reports indicate\\ntowards the lack of evidence stating the resistance to\\nremdesivir induced by the VOCs.\\nSimilarly, molnupiravir, a recently FDA approved\\nantiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection is also\\nknown to function through targeting the viral poly-\\nmerase and misdirecting it to incorporate adenosine\\nor guanosine during viral replication, thereby leading\\nto an accumulation of deleterious errors eventually\\n– rendering the virus non-infectious [ 53 55 ]. Therefore,\\nsince reports have proved that the sequences respon-\\nsible for viral RdRp activity remains to be conserved in\\nearly and novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is unlikely that\\nthe novel VOCs could interfere in the activity of such\\nantiviral drugs. Moreover, other reports also advocate\\nthe unrestricted use of the recent FDA approved\\nPaxlovid antiviral drug against the existing VOCs and\\nespecially the most recent omicron variant [ 56 ].\\nTherefore, in the light of the above knowledge it may\\nbe safe to state that the activity of such antivirals may\\nremain unhindered against the emerging VOCs.\\n3.2.

A recent study conducted\\non the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants proved that both\\nvariants presented a low genetic variation in the RNA\\nreplication complex and the most frequent observed\\nsubstitution was Nsp12 P323L. However, this substitu-\\ntion was not located near the polymerase active site,\\nthus did not affect the inhibition function of remdesi-\\nvir [ 49 ]. In addition, according to Lee et al. the amino\\nacid sequences of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOCs were\\nfound to possess numerous mutations in the spike\\nprotein, when compared to the early SARS-CoV-2\\nstrains [ 50 ].

Moreover, Showers et al. also reported\\nno difference in the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir\\nbetween early SARS-CoV-2 and these new variants\\n[ 51 ]. Furthermore, another study that analyzed the\\nprotein sequence of RdRp among SARS-CoV-2 emer-\\ngent variants show a high conservation in remdesivir-\\nbinding residues [ 52 ]. Therefore, these reports indicate\\ntowards the lack of evidence stating the resistance to\\nremdesivir induced by the VOCs.\\nSimilarly, molnupiravir, a recently FDA approved\\nantiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection is also\\nknown to function through targeting the viral poly-\\nmerase and misdirecting it to incorporate adenosine\\nor guanosine during viral replication, thereby leading\\nto an accumulation of deleterious errors eventually\\n– rendering the virus non-infectious [ 53 55 ]. Therefore,\\nsince reports have proved that the sequences respon-\\nsible for viral RdRp activity remains to be conserved in\\nearly and novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is unlikely that\\nthe novel VOCs could interfere in the activity of such\\nantiviral drugs. Moreover, other reports also advocate\\nthe unrestricted use of the recent FDA approved\\nPaxlovid antiviral drug against the existing VOCs and\\nespecially the most recent omicron variant [ 56 ].\\nTherefore, in the light of the above knowledge it may\\nbe safe to state that the activity of such antivirals may\\nremain unhindered against the emerging VOCs.\\n3.2.

In the case of antiviral drugs,\\nRemdesivir has gained sufficient recognition for its\\nability to contain and manage the viral load and was\\napproved by FDA for the treatment of COVID-19\\npatients with pneumonia concurrent with the shortage\\nof oxygen supply [ 30 ]. It is a broad-spectrum adeno-\\nsine nucleotide analogue and phosphoramidate pro-\\ndrug that can target a wide range of viruses includes\\ncoronaviruses.

In addition, another study showed that a combin-\\nation of remdesivir with baricitinib worked better in\\nreducing recovery time of hospitalized patients with\\nCOVID-19 pneumonia [ 33 ]. Baricitinib is a Janus\\n– kinase STAT signalling inhibitor (JAK-STAT) that pos-\\nsesses antiviral and anti-inflammatory action through\\nthe inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and\\ncontrols the elevation of cytokine levels. [ 34 ].\\nMoreover, certain anti-HIV drugs like lopinavir and\\nritonavir that target RNA viruses (retroviruses) were\\nreported to improve the symptoms of patients with SARS\\n[ 35 ]. Therefore, they were evaluated for their potential use\\nas a therapeutic agent against COVID-19. However,\\naccording to a certain report, no benefit was observed\\n– with lopinavir ritonavir treatment beyond standard care\\nin adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 [ 36 ].\\nSimilarly, chloroquine, a drug whose sulphate and phos-\\nphate salts have been commercialized as anti-malarial\\ndrugs was also shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-2\\n– infections according to a few studies [ 37 40 ].

However, a\\nrecent trial proved that post-exposure hydroxychloro-\\nquine therapy did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in\\nhealthy individuals exposed to an infected patient [ 41 ]. In\\naddition, other studies have also discredited protease\\ninhibitors like lopinavir and ritonavir and chloroquine to\\nmodel potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy [ 42 , 43 ].\\nRecently, two monoclonal antibodies, Tocilizumab\\nand Sarilumab used as anti-inflammatory drugs for\\nrheumatoid arthritis [ 44 ] have been repurposed for their\\nuse against SARS-CoV-2 Tocilizumab was approved as an\\nimmunotherapy drug by FDA for the treatment against\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 529\\nthe cytokine storm release that is a hallmark of particu-\\nlarly critical COVID-19 infections [ 30 , 45 ]. These monoclo-\\nnal antibodies function by antagonizing both\\nmembrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 receptors\\n[ 44 ], thereby resulting in the blocking of the down-\\nstream signal transduction that induces the cytokine\\nrelease syndrome [ 46 ]. Moreover, the clinical trials of the\\nRandomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive\\nPlatform Trial for Community-Acquired pneumonia\\n(REMAP-CAP) showed that Tocilizumab and Sarilumab\\nimproved survival rate and reduced mortality in hospital-\\nized Covid-19 patients by 28 and 22.2% respectively,\\nwhen administrated within 24h of entering intensive\\ncare units (ICUs) [ 30 , 44 , 47 ]. According to the NHS guid-\\nance, both drugs are advocated for the treatment of\\nhospitalized Covid-19 patients in ICUs [ 47 ].\\nFurther, Casirivimab with Imdevimab forms a unique\\nTM . monoclonal antibody cocktail named REGEN- COV\\nThese antibodies bind non-competitively to the SARS-\\nCoV-2 spike protein, thus being beneficial in targeting\\nthe novel mutant SARS-CoV-2 variants and lowering\\nchances of their immune escape [ 48 ]. Results of the\\nTM phase 3 trial showed that REGEN-COV decreased hos-\\npitalization or death by 70% in non-hospitalized Covid-\\n19 patients. In addition, it has also been approved by\\nthe FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases in\\nadults and paediatric Covid-19 patients and in patients\\nat high risk of disease severity [ 48 ].\\n3.1.1. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs on the\\nemerging VOCs\\nIn the wake of the recent emergences of new SARS-\\nCoV-2 variants, it has become increasingly important\\nto evaluate whether the current therapeutics still\\nmaintain efficacy against the novel variants. In fact,\\nin-vitro several studies were conducted to assess the\\nefficacy of remdesivir against new COVID- 19 variants\\nand more importantly to determine whether these\\nVOCs expressed mutations in the RNA- Dependent\\nRNA Polymerase (RdRP) protein sequence, which is the\\nmain target of remdesivir. A recent study conducted\\non the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants proved that both\\nvariants presented a low genetic variation in the RNA\\nreplication complex and the most frequent observed\\nsubstitution\n```",

However, a\\nrecent trial proved that post-exposure hydroxychloro-\\nquine therapy did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in\\nhealthy individuals exposed to an infected patient [ 41 ]. In\\naddition, other studies have also discredited protease\\ninhibitors like lopinavir and ritonavir and chloroquine to\\nmodel potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy [ 42 , 43 ].\\nRecently, two monoclonal antibodies, Tocilizumab\\nand Sarilumab used as anti-inflammatory drugs for\\nrheumatoid arthritis [ 44 ] have been repurposed for their\\nuse against SARS-CoV-2 Tocilizumab was approved as an\\nimmunotherapy drug by FDA for the treatment against\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 529\\nthe cytokine storm release that is a hallmark of particu-\\nlarly critical COVID-19 infections [ 30 , 45 ]. These monoclo-\\nnal antibodies function by antagonizing both\\nmembrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 receptors\\n[ 44 ], thereby resulting in the blocking of the down-\\nstream signal transduction that induces the cytokine\\nrelease syndrome [ 46 ]. Moreover, the clinical trials of the\\nRandomized, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive\\nPlatform Trial for Community-Acquired pneumonia\\n(REMAP-CAP) showed that Tocilizumab and Sarilumab\\nimproved survival rate and reduced mortality in hospital-\\nized Covid-19 patients by 28 and 22.2% respectively,\\nwhen administrated within 24h of entering intensive\\ncare units (ICUs) [ 30 , 44 , 47 ]. According to the NHS guid-\\nance, both drugs are advocated for the treatment of\\nhospitalized Covid-19 patients in ICUs [ 47 ].\\nFurther, Casirivimab with Imdevimab forms a unique\\nTM . monoclonal antibody cocktail named REGEN- COV\\nThese antibodies bind non-competitively to the SARS-\\nCoV-2 spike protein, thus being beneficial in targeting\\nthe novel mutant SARS-CoV-2 variants and lowering\\nchances of their immune escape [ 48 ]. Results of the\\nTM phase 3 trial showed that REGEN-COV decreased hos-\\npitalization or death by 70% in non-hospitalized Covid-\\n19 patients. In addition, it has also been approved by\\nthe FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases in\\nadults and paediatric Covid-19 patients and in patients\\nat high risk of disease severity [ 48 ].\\n3.1.1. Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs on the\\nemerging VOCs\\nIn the wake of the recent emergences of new SARS-\\nCoV-2 variants, it has become increasingly important\\nto evaluate whether the current therapeutics still\\nmaintain efficacy against the novel variants. In fact,\\nin-vitro several studies were conducted to assess the\\nefficacy of remdesivir against new COVID- 19 variants\\nand more importantly to determine whether these\\nVOCs expressed mutations in the RNA- Dependent\\nRNA Polymerase (RdRP) protein sequence, which is the\\nmain target of remdesivir.

Protein subunit vaccines NVX-CoV2373\\nNVX-CoV2373 (Novavax ) is a SARS-COV-2 subunit vac-\\ncine constructed from the full-length SARS- COV-2\\nspike glycoprotein and is produced in the established\\nbaculovirus-Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell\\nexpression system [ 57 ]. This vaccine is formulated\\nthrough the use of nanoparticles containing trimeric\\nfull-length SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein adjuvant with\\nsaponin based Matrix-M [ 58 ]. Studies have shown that\\nthis Matrix-M can enhance immune responses by pro-\\nmoting the recruitment, activation, and maturation of\\n\\nvia central immune cells enhanced antigen presenta-\\ntion and uptake by the antigen presenting cells [ 59 ].\\nThe safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373\\nwas initially tested in a nonhuman primate (baboons\\nand cynomolgus macaque) and mice models.\\nPreliminary results showed that the vaccine elicits a T\\ncell and B cell response, induces a high titre of anti-S\\nIgG and SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies and pro-\\ntects the upper and lower respiratory track from virus\\ninfection and pulmonary disease [ 57 , 60 ]. Subsequently,\\nPhase 1-2 clinical trial were conducted to evaluate the\\nsafety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombin-\\nant S nanoparticle vaccine on humans with or without\\nMatrix-M adjuvant [ 58 ]. The outcomes of these trials\\nindicated that the vaccine has a reassuring safety pro-\\nfile and is capable of inducing a robust humoral and T\\ncell immune response [ 61 ]. Moreover, the levels of\\nneutralizing antibodies and anti-S IgG detected in vac-\\ncinated participants was indeed found to be 4 times\\nhigher than those observed in symptomatic COVID-19\\noutpatient sera [ 61 ]. In addition, this vaccine also indu-\\nþ ces a predominant CD4 T cell response characterized\\nc a by high production of IFN- , IL-2, and TNF- .\\nCurrently, phase 3 trials are ongoing in 5 different\\ncountries (United Kingdom (UK), Northern Ireland,\\nMexico, Puerto Rico and United States of America)\\n[ 62 ].

Protein subunit vaccines NVX-CoV2373\\nNVX-CoV2373 (Novavax ) is a SARS-COV-2 subunit vac-\\ncine constructed from the full-length SARS- COV-2\\nspike glycoprotein and is produced in the established\\nbaculovirus-Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell\\nexpression system [ 57 ]. This vaccine is formulated\\nthrough the use of nanoparticles containing trimeric\\nfull-length SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein adjuvant with\\nsaponin based Matrix-M [ 58 ]. Studies have shown that\\nthis Matrix-M can enhance immune responses by pro-\\nmoting the recruitment, activation, and maturation of\\n\\nvia central immune cells enhanced antigen presenta-\\ntion and uptake by the antigen presenting cells [ 59 ].\\nThe safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373\\nwas initially tested in a nonhuman primate (baboons\\nand cynomolgus macaque) and mice models.\\nPreliminary results showed that the vaccine elicits a T\\ncell and B cell response, induces a high titre of anti-S\\nIgG and SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies and pro-\\ntects the upper and lower respiratory track from virus\\ninfection and pulmonary disease [ 57 , 60 ]. Subsequently,\\nPhase 1-2 clinical trial were conducted to evaluate the\\nsafety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 recombin-\\nant S nanoparticle vaccine on humans with or without\\nMatrix-M adjuvant [ 58 ]. The outcomes of these trials\\nindicated that the vaccine has a reassuring safety pro-\\nfile and is capable of inducing a robust humoral and T\\ncell immune response [ 61 ]. Moreover, the levels of\\nneutralizing antibodies and anti-S IgG detected in vac-\\ncinated participants was indeed found to be 4 times\\nhigher than those observed in symptomatic COVID-19\\noutpatient sera [ 61 ]. In addition, this vaccine also indu-\\nþ ces a predominant CD4 T cell response characterized\\nc a by high production of IFN- , IL-2, and TNF- .\\nCurrently, phase 3 trials are ongoing in 5 different\\ncountries (United Kingdom (UK), Northern Ireland,\\nMexico, Puerto Rico and United States of America)\\n[ 62 ]. However, preliminary data from the UK indicates\\nthat the efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 is estimated at\\n89.7% among different subgroups including partici-\\npants with comorbidities, with no hospitalization or\\ndeaths reported in vaccinated individuals [ 63 ].\\nInterestingly, the same study indicates that NVX-\\nCoV2373 has a strong efficacy (86.3%) against the UK\\nvariant (B.1.1.7) [ 63 ].\\n3.2.2. Adenovirus vector-based vaccines\\n3.2.2.1. ZD1222. The AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) is\\na recombinant adenovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine\\nconstructed from the replication-deficient simian chim-\\npanzee adenovirus vector (ChAdOx2) expressing the\\nfull- length SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein [ 64 ].\\nChimpanzee vectors are highly suitable for the devel-\\nopment of human vaccines due to their high immuno-\\ngenicity and genome stability that prevents the\\ndeletion or mutation of foreign genes [ 65 ].

However, in\\nphase 2, which began no earlier than 5 days after the\\nphase 1 vaccination, participants were administrated a\\nsingle intramuscular dose of rAD26-S on day 0 fol-\\nlowed by another dose of rAD5-S on day 21 [ 76 ].\\nPreliminary data from the phase 1 trials show that no\\nsevere adverse reactions were detected in participants\\nafter vaccination [ 76 ]. Also, the frozen formulation was\\nfound to be induce a higher IgG titre (14.703 versus\\n11.143) and neutralizing antibodies (49.25 versus\\n45.95) while eliciting higher CD4 (2.5 versus 1.3) and\\nCD8 (1.3 versus 1.1) T cell proliferation rates as com-\\npared to the lyophilized formulation indicating the fro-\\nzen formulation to be more effective than the\\nlyophilized one [ 76 ].\\nPhase 3 clinical trials were performed on a larger\\nscale (nearly 22,000 adults aged at least 18 years) [ 84 ].\\nParticipants received 2 doses of the vaccine (dose 1\\nrAD26-S and dose 2 rAD5-S) or a placebo, 21 days apart\\n[ 84 ]. Results of this phase showed that the vaccine effi-\\ncacy was estimated at 91.6%. In addition, 94% of the\\nparticipants presented mild adverse reactions, while a\\nminority (less than 0.5%) exhibited severe adverse events\\n[ 84 ]. Though four deaths were reported among partici-\\npants, the cause of death was linked to the vaccine but\\nrather to severe comorbidities [ 84 ]. Interestingly, a recent\\nstudy showed that sera from a donor vaccinated with\\nGam-COVID-Vac efficiently neutralized the spike protein\\nfrom B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains [ 85 ]. This data suggest\\nthat this vaccine may offer protection against different\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants.\\n3.2.3. mRNA vaccines\\nSince more than a decade, mRNA based therapeutics\\nhave raised major interest in cancer and infectious dis-\\neases likewise [ 86 ]. Particularly, immunization through\\n\\nmRNA vaccines was found to be effective against sev-\\neral viral infections. It has been reported that mRNA\\nvaccines are able to induce potent innate and adap-\\ntive immune reactions against Rabies, Zika and\\nInfluenza A infections in animal models and in humans\\n– [ 87 90 ]. Therefore, it is not surprising that mRNA vac-\\ncines have now emerged as an effective preventive\\nstrategy against SARS-CoV-2 infections. This technol-\\nogy is based on the principle that mRNA is an inter-\\nmediate messenger that can be easily delivered into\\nhost cells and translated into antigen of interest that\\nwill trigger a protective antigen-specific immune\\nresponse in the human body. Within a year from the\\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA vaccines,\\nnamely, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273\\n(Moderna biotechnologies Inc.) were approved by the\\nFDA for emergency use as a prevention against SARS-\\nCoV-2 infection.\\nBoth vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, carry a\\nnucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the\\nfull-length SARS\n```",

However, in\\nphase 2, which began no earlier than 5 days after the\\nphase 1 vaccination, participants were administrated a\\nsingle intramuscular dose of rAD26-S on day 0 fol-\\nlowed by another dose of rAD5-S on day 21 [ 76 ].\\nPreliminary data from the phase 1 trials show that no\\nsevere adverse reactions were detected in participants\\nafter vaccination [ 76 ]. Also, the frozen formulation was\\nfound to be induce a higher IgG titre (14.703 versus\\n11.143) and neutralizing antibodies (49.25 versus\\n45.95) while eliciting higher CD4 (2.5 versus 1.3) and\\nCD8 (1.3 versus 1.1) T cell proliferation rates as com-\\npared to the lyophilized formulation indicating the fro-\\nzen formulation to be more effective than the\\nlyophilized one [ 76 ].\\nPhase 3 clinical trials were performed on a larger\\nscale (nearly 22,000 adults aged at least 18 years) [ 84 ].\\nParticipants received 2 doses of the vaccine (dose 1\\nrAD26-S and dose 2 rAD5-S) or a placebo, 21 days apart\\n[ 84 ]. Results of this phase showed that the vaccine effi-\\ncacy was estimated at 91.6%. In addition, 94% of the\\nparticipants presented mild adverse reactions, while a\\nminority (less than 0.5%) exhibited severe adverse events\\n[ 84 ]. Though four deaths were reported among partici-\\npants, the cause of death was linked to the vaccine but\\nrather to severe comorbidities [ 84 ]. Interestingly, a recent\\nstudy showed that sera from a donor vaccinated with\\nGam-COVID-Vac efficiently neutralized the spike protein\\nfrom B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains [ 85 ]. This data suggest\\nthat this vaccine may offer protection against different\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants.\\n3.2.3. mRNA vaccines\\nSince more than a decade, mRNA based therapeutics\\nhave raised major interest in cancer and infectious dis-\\neases likewise [ 86 ]. Particularly, immunization through\\n\\nmRNA vaccines was found to be effective against sev-\\neral viral infections. It has been reported that mRNA\\nvaccines are able to induce potent innate and adap-\\ntive immune reactions against Rabies, Zika and\\nInfluenza A infections in animal models and in humans\\n– [ 87 90 ]. Therefore, it is not surprising that mRNA vac-\\ncines have now emerged as an effective preventive\\nstrategy against SARS-CoV-2 infections. This technol-\\nogy is based on the principle that mRNA is an inter-\\nmediate messenger that can be easily delivered into\\nhost cells and translated into antigen of interest that\\nwill trigger a protective antigen-specific immune\\nresponse in the human body. Within a year from the\\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA vaccines,\\nnamely, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273\\n(Moderna biotechnologies Inc.) were approved by the\\nFDA for emergency use as a prevention against SARS-\\nCoV-2 infection.\\nBoth vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, carry a\\nnucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the\\nfull-length SARS\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

These LNPs form a solid lipid\\ncomplex that encapsulate and stabilize the mRNA and\\npromotes its intracellular uptake [ 88 , 91 ]. While both\\nvaccines are administered intramuscularly in two\\nshots, the second dose is administered after 21 days\\nfor BNT162b2 and 28 days for mRNA-1273.\\nPhase III clinical trials have demonstrated that\\nBNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines have exhibited\\nmore than 90% protection efficacy in people with no\\n– prior known infection [ 92 95 ]. In fact, Polack et al.\\ndemonstrated that the BNT162b2 vaccine conferred\\n95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years\\nof age and older, with only mild adverse effects that\\nwere similar to those observed with other known viral\\nvaccines (short-term fatigue, headache, mild-to-moder-\\nate pain at the injection site) [ 93 ]. Moreover, the COVE\\nstudy group in the USA has reported that the mRNA-\\n1273 vaccine has presented 94.1% efficacy in prevent-\\ning COVID-19 illness with no patterns of safety con-\\ncerns [ 92 ]. In another recent study, Thompson et al.\\nhave shown that, for both mRNA vaccines, full immun-\\nization with 2 doses of vaccine provides 90% effective-\\n\\u0006 ness against COVID-19 at 14 days following the\\nsecond dose [ 96 ]. However, while the mRNA-1273 vac-\\ncine is only approved for use in people aged 18 years\\nand older, the BNT162b2 vaccine has been recently\\ngranted authorization by the FDA to be used in ado-\\nlescents aged 12 to 15 years old [ 97 ]. Moreover, recent\\nstudies have reported that the BNT162b2 vaccine pro-\\n\\u0006 vides strong protection ( 95%) against the COVID-19\",\r\n        \"char_count\": 5367,\r\n        \"word_count\": 893,\r\n        \"extraction_method\": \"two_column\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"page_number\": 10,\r\n        \"text\": \"variants detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and\\nSouth Africa (B.1.351) [ 98 , 99 ].

As for the mRNA-1273 vaccine, further studies\\nare needed to confirm its effectiveness against the\\nemerging COVID-19 variants.\\nEvidently, the immunogenic potential of COVID-19\\nmRNA vaccines have already been documented\\nthrough various preclinical and clinical trials\\n[ 89 , 92 , 93 , 101 ].

Interestingly, a phase I clinical trial on\\n47 participants demonstrated that the mRNA-1273\\ninduces a robust immune response which was time\\nand dose-dependent [ 101 ]. Additionally, while CD4 T\\ncells expression was upregulated in response to the\\nvaccination, only low level of CD8 T cells were\\ndetected at the highest tested concentration and after\\nthe second vaccination dose [ 101 ]. Moreover, another\\nstudy showed that BNT162b2 induces a broad\\nimmune response with SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific neu-\\nþ þ tralizing antibodies and poly-specific CD4 and CD8\\nT cells [ 102 ]. Interestingly, the same study has\\nreported a strong memory T cell response up to nine\\nweeks after the booster dose [ 102 ].\\nApparently, in comparison to other approved vac-\\ncines platforms, mRNA-based vaccines have several\\nadvantages. For example, in the situation of a wide-\\nspread global pandemic such as COVID-19, mRNA vac-\\ncine production is rapid and can be manufactured on\\nlarger scales at relatively lower costs. Moreover, mRNA\\nvaccines are considered safe since they do not contain\\nthe full pathogen (unlike vaccines integrating live-vec-\\ntors or inactivated viruses), and do not carry the viral\\nDNA material that might be associated to genotoxic\\nconcerns (like DNA-based vaccines) [ 88 , 103 ].\\nHowever, the major problem with mRNA vaccines is\\nthe stability of the formulation since they require a\\nstrict temperature control for shipment and storage to\\navoid the degradation of the mRNA. Moreover, the\\ninduced activation of the immune system would\\npotentially lead to side effects associated with\\nenhanced inflammatory processes. Therefore, although\\nmRNA vaccines project a powerful strategy to contain\\nthe COVID-19 outbreak, more studies are needed to\\nconfirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of\\nthese vaccines.\\n3.2.4. Whole virus vaccines\\nHistorically, whole viral inactivation is one of the old-\\nest strategies that have been successfully used to pro-\\nduce vaccines to prevent/treat a variety of viral\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 533\\ndiseases including influenza, poliomyelitis and human\\n– papillomavirus infections [ 104 106 ]. In comparison to\\nother whole pathogen-containing vaccines, such as\\nlive attenuated virus vaccines, the use of inactivated\\nvirus vaccines pose fewer safety concerns, since the\\npathogen cannot revert to its original state and cause\\ndiseases in immunocompromised individuals [ 107 ].\\nMoreover, since they contain the killed pathogen, they\\ncan be easily stored and shipped.\\n’ According to WHO s draft landscape of SARS-CoV-2\\ncandidate vaccines, 12 inactivated virus vaccines (14%)\\nare currently in the clinical phase testing. For instance,\\npharmaceutical companies like Sinovac and\\nSinopharm, both arising from China have produced\\ninactivated viral vaccines that are currently in phase 3\\nand 4 of clinical trials respectively [ 108 ].\\n3.2.4.1. COVID-19 vaccine (Vero cell) inactivated.\\nCOVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated (CoronaVac\\n(formerly PiCoVacc)) developed by Sinovac Biotech\\nLtd, is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CN2 strain) vaccine\\nadjuvant containing aluminium hydroxide (Al (OH)3)\\nand is administrated through a two-dose regimen\\nm (3 g at day\n```",

These LNPs form a solid lipid\\ncomplex that encapsulate and stabilize the mRNA and\\npromotes its intracellular uptake [ 88 , 91 ]. While both\\nvaccines are administered intramuscularly in two\\nshots, the second dose is administered after 21 days\\nfor BNT162b2 and 28 days for mRNA-1273.\\nPhase III clinical trials have demonstrated that\\nBNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines have exhibited\\nmore than 90% protection efficacy in people with no\\n– prior known infection [ 92 95 ]. In fact, Polack et al.\\ndemonstrated that the BNT162b2 vaccine conferred\\n95% protection against COVID-19 in persons 16 years\\nof age and older, with only mild adverse effects that\\nwere similar to those observed with other known viral\\nvaccines (short-term fatigue, headache, mild-to-moder-\\nate pain at the injection site) [ 93 ]. Moreover, the COVE\\nstudy group in the USA has reported that the mRNA-\\n1273 vaccine has presented 94.1% efficacy in prevent-\\ning COVID-19 illness with no patterns of safety con-\\ncerns [ 92 ]. In another recent study, Thompson et al.\\nhave shown that, for both mRNA vaccines, full immun-\\nization with 2 doses of vaccine provides 90% effective-\\n\\u0006 ness against COVID-19 at 14 days following the\\nsecond dose [ 96 ]. However, while the mRNA-1273 vac-\\ncine is only approved for use in people aged 18 years\\nand older, the BNT162b2 vaccine has been recently\\ngranted authorization by the FDA to be used in ado-\\nlescents aged 12 to 15 years old [ 97 ]. Moreover, recent\\nstudies have reported that the BNT162b2 vaccine pro-\\n\\u0006 vides strong protection ( 95%) against the COVID-19\",\r\n        \"char_count\": 5367,\r\n        \"word_count\": 893,\r\n        \"extraction_method\": \"two_column\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"page_number\": 10,\r\n        \"text\": \"variants detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and\\nSouth Africa (B.1.351) [ 98 , 99 ].

As for the mRNA-1273 vaccine, further studies\\nare needed to confirm its effectiveness against the\\nemerging COVID-19 variants.\\nEvidently, the immunogenic potential of COVID-19\\nmRNA vaccines have already been documented\\nthrough various preclinical and clinical trials\\n[ 89 , 92 , 93 , 101 ].

Although only a small num-\\nber of studies have been published for the COVID-19\\nVaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated vaccine, very few cases\\nof hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions\\n(0.009%) have been reported [ 115 , 116 ].\\n3.2.4.2. Covilo; BIBP-CorV. Covilo; BIBP-CorV\\n(Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine) is one of two inac-\\ntivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by\\nSinopharm. Few studies have investigated the\\nimmunogenicity and efficacy of BBIBP-CorV. The first\\nstudy on BBIBP-CorV has showed that the vaccine\\ninduces high levels of neutralizing antibodies in six\\nmammalian species including mice, rats, guinea pigs,\\nrabbits, and non- human primates (cynomolgus mon-\\nkeys and rhesus macaques). Interestingly, this study\\nreported that two doses of immunization of BBIBP-\\nCorV at 2 mg/dose, is able to provide high protection\\nagainst SARS- CoV-2 without detectable antibody\\ndependent enhancement of infection [ 117 ]. In add-\\nition, all macaques in the low and high dose groups\\ndid not show a detectable viral load in any lung lobe\\nat 7 days after inoculation of BBIBP-CorV. Also in com-\\nparison to the AZD1222 vaccine, both vaccines were\\nfound to confer effective protection by preventing the\\ndevelopment of viral interstitial pneumonia in all vac-\\ncinated macaques [ 118 ].\\nPhase I (192 adults) and phase II (448 adults) clin-\\nical trials for the BBIBP-CorV vaccine, have shown that\\nthe vaccine is safe and well tolerated at all tested\\ndoses. Antibodies were elicited against SARS-\\nCoV-2 in all vaccine recipients at 42days after the\\nsecond dose. These trials included individuals older than\\n60 that showed significantly high neutralizing antibody\\ntitres [ 119 ]. Moreover, a particular report also stated that\\nthe vaccine had a low rate of adverse reactions and\\nshowed high immunogenicity. Yet, however, long-term\\nassessment of safety and efficacy would require phase III\\ntrials [ 120 ]. The first peer- reviewed data obtained in\\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain showed that\\nBBIBP-CorV is 78.1% effective against symptomatic cases\\n\\nand 100% effective against severe cases [ 121 ]. In add-\\nition, UAE previously announced interim results showing\\nthat the vaccine provided 86% efficacy [ 122 ].\\nAdditionally, Sinopharm has started a phase III trial in\\nseveral countries in Africa [ 123 , 124 ], Asia and Europe\\n[ 125 ]. Reports from a randomized, double blind, placebo\\nparallel-controlled phase III clinical trial in Argentina\\nshowed that the vaccine portrayed a lower effectiveness\\n(79%) as compared to other approved COVID-19 mRNA\\nvaccines. However, this vaccine has an advantage stor-\\nage and shipment protocols at regular refrigeration\\ntemperatures.\\n3.2.5. Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines on the emerg-\\ning VOCs\\nGiven the alarming frequency of the emergence of\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants, the efficacy of the existing vac-\\ncines remains in question. In the light of this, it may\\nbe encouraging to state that in addition to the gen-\\neral public, even patients with co-morbidities like can-\\ncer and other immuno-compromised individuals like\\nsolid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) have also\\nshown the development of neutral\n```",

Interestingly, a phase I clinical trial on\\n47 participants demonstrated that the mRNA-1273\\ninduces a robust immune response which was time\\nand dose-dependent [ 101 ]. Additionally, while CD4 T\\ncells expression was upregulated in response to the\\nvaccination, only low level of CD8 T cells were\\ndetected at the highest tested concentration and after\\nthe second vaccination dose [ 101 ]. Moreover, another\\nstudy showed that BNT162b2 induces a broad\\nimmune response with SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific neu-\\nþ þ tralizing antibodies and poly-specific CD4 and CD8\\nT cells [ 102 ]. Interestingly, the same study has\\nreported a strong memory T cell response up to nine\\nweeks after the booster dose [ 102 ].\\nApparently, in comparison to other approved vac-\\ncines platforms, mRNA-based vaccines have several\\nadvantages. For example, in the situation of a wide-\\nspread global pandemic such as COVID-19, mRNA vac-\\ncine production is rapid and can be manufactured on\\nlarger scales at relatively lower costs. Moreover, mRNA\\nvaccines are considered safe since they do not contain\\nthe full pathogen (unlike vaccines integrating live-vec-\\ntors or inactivated viruses), and do not carry the viral\\nDNA material that might be associated to genotoxic\\nconcerns (like DNA-based vaccines) [ 88 , 103 ].\\nHowever, the major problem with mRNA vaccines is\\nthe stability of the formulation since they require a\\nstrict temperature control for shipment and storage to\\navoid the degradation of the mRNA. Moreover, the\\ninduced activation of the immune system would\\npotentially lead to side effects associated with\\nenhanced inflammatory processes. Therefore, although\\nmRNA vaccines project a powerful strategy to contain\\nthe COVID-19 outbreak, more studies are needed to\\nconfirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of\\nthese vaccines.\\n3.2.4. Whole virus vaccines\\nHistorically, whole viral inactivation is one of the old-\\nest strategies that have been successfully used to pro-\\nduce vaccines to prevent/treat a variety of viral\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 533\\ndiseases including influenza, poliomyelitis and human\\n– papillomavirus infections [ 104 106 ]. In comparison to\\nother whole pathogen-containing vaccines, such as\\nlive attenuated virus vaccines, the use of inactivated\\nvirus vaccines pose fewer safety concerns, since the\\npathogen cannot revert to its original state and cause\\ndiseases in immunocompromised individuals [ 107 ].\\nMoreover, since they contain the killed pathogen, they\\ncan be easily stored and shipped.\\n’ According to WHO s draft landscape of SARS-CoV-2\\ncandidate vaccines, 12 inactivated virus vaccines (14%)\\nare currently in the clinical phase testing. For instance,\\npharmaceutical companies like Sinovac and\\nSinopharm, both arising from China have produced\\ninactivated viral vaccines that are currently in phase 3\\nand 4 of clinical trials respectively [ 108 ].\\n3.2.4.1.

Although only a small num-\\nber of studies have been published for the COVID-19\\nVaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated vaccine, very few cases\\nof hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions\\n(0.009%) have been reported [ 115 , 116 ].\\n3.2.4.2. Covilo; BIBP-CorV. Covilo; BIBP-CorV\\n(Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine) is one of two inac-\\ntivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by\\nSinopharm. Few studies have investigated the\\nimmunogenicity and efficacy of BBIBP-CorV. The first\\nstudy on BBIBP-CorV has showed that the vaccine\\ninduces high levels of neutralizing antibodies in six\\nmammalian species including mice, rats, guinea pigs,\\nrabbits, and non- human primates (cynomolgus mon-\\nkeys and rhesus macaques). Interestingly, this study\\nreported that two doses of immunization of BBIBP-\\nCorV at 2 mg/dose, is able to provide high protection\\nagainst SARS- CoV-2 without detectable antibody\\ndependent enhancement of infection [ 117 ]. In add-\\nition, all macaques in the low and high dose groups\\ndid not show a detectable viral load in any lung lobe\\nat 7 days after inoculation of BBIBP-CorV. Also in com-\\nparison to the AZD1222 vaccine, both vaccines were\\nfound to confer effective protection by preventing the\\ndevelopment of viral interstitial pneumonia in all vac-\\ncinated macaques [ 118 ].\\nPhase I (192 adults) and phase II (448 adults) clin-\\nical trials for the BBIBP-CorV vaccine, have shown that\\nthe vaccine is safe and well tolerated at all tested\\ndoses. Antibodies were elicited against SARS-\\nCoV-2 in all vaccine recipients at 42days after the\\nsecond dose. These trials included individuals older than\\n60 that showed significantly high neutralizing antibody\\ntitres [ 119 ]. Moreover, a particular report also stated that\\nthe vaccine had a low rate of adverse reactions and\\nshowed high immunogenicity. Yet, however, long-term\\nassessment of safety and efficacy would require phase III\\ntrials [ 120 ]. The first peer- reviewed data obtained in\\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain showed that\\nBBIBP-CorV is 78.1% effective against symptomatic cases\\n\\nand 100% effective against severe cases [ 121 ]. In add-\\nition, UAE previously announced interim results showing\\nthat the vaccine provided 86% efficacy [ 122 ].\\nAdditionally, Sinopharm has started a phase III trial in\\nseveral countries in Africa [ 123 , 124 ], Asia and Europe\\n[ 125 ]. Reports from a randomized, double blind, placebo\\nparallel-controlled phase III clinical trial in Argentina\\nshowed that the vaccine portrayed a lower effectiveness\\n(79%) as compared to other approved COVID-19 mRNA\\nvaccines. However, this vaccine has an advantage stor-\\nage and shipment protocols at regular refrigeration\\ntemperatures.\\n3.2.5. Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines on the emerg-\\ning VOCs\\nGiven the alarming frequency of the emergence of\\nSARS-CoV-2 variants, the efficacy of the existing vac-\\ncines remains in question. In the light of this, it may\\nbe encouraging to state that in addition to the gen-\\neral public, even patients with co-morbidities like can-\\ncer and other immuno-compromised individuals like\\nsolid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) have also\\nshown the development of neutral\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

In the light of this, it may\\nbe encouraging to state that in addition to the gen-\\neral public, even patients with co-morbidities like can-\\ncer and other immuno-compromised individuals like\\nsolid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) have also\\nshown the development of neutralizing antibodies\\nupon vaccination with most conventional vaccines, as\\ndiscussed in the following reports. According to cer-\\ntain studies, SOTRs may be more commonly associated\\nwith breakthrough disease despite being fully vacci-\\nnated as compared to the general population\\n[ 126 , 127 ]. Other studies have also reported that most\\nSORTs often develop weak antibody responses against\\n– SARS-CoV-2 m-RNA vaccines [ 128 130 ]. However,\\naccording to another subsequent study even such vul-\\nnerable populations are reported to show an increase\\nin neutralizing antibodies against novel VOCs after the\\nthird dose of a\\nSARS-CoV-2 vaccine [ 131 ]. In addition, the CAPTURE\\nstudy also reported the presence of neutralizing anti-\\nbodies against the novel COVID-19 VOCs in patients\\nwith both solid and hematological cancers, upon\\nimmunization with the BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccine.\\nAlthough these studies report that the vaccination-\\ndependent stimulation of an immune response against\\nthe novel VOCs in such vulnerable populations is\\nmuch lowered as compared to normal healthy individ-\\nuals; yet these results are indeed promising and prove\\nthe potency of the currently available vaccines to\\ncombat the existing and emerging VOCs.\\nIn addition, the utilization of computational\\napproaches to predict the impact of the VOCs on the\\nvaccines has also proven useful. For example, certain\\ncomputational approaches like epitope prediction that\\nenables the identification of structural vaccinology\",\r\n        \"char_count\": 5245,\r\n        \"word_count\": 812,\r\n        \"extraction_method\": \"two_column\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"page_number\": 12,\r\n        \"text\": \"targets may also help in modelling the effects of the\\nmutations in the spike proteins observed in the\\nemerging VOCs [ 132 , 133 ]. Moreover, another study\\nhas also provided a reliable model for epitope loss in\\nVOCs and their predicted escape from vaccine-\\ninduced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [ 134 ]. Such computa-\\ntional approaches prove to be highly useful in foresee-\\ning the impact of the emerging VOCs on the efficacy\\nof COVID-19 vaccines.\\n4. Challenges\\nSince the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, its invasive\\nproperties have not yet been well studied or under-\\nstood. However, some studies have highlighted a new\\npotential threat in the form of identifying the possible\\nneuro-invasive properties of the novel virus. For\\nexample, although the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are\\nboth known to enter and infect host cells through\\nACE2 expressed in the lung cells; according to some\\nstudies, ACE2 is not the only receptor that makes host\\ncells susceptible to viral infection. For example, human\\nendothelial and intestinal cells that express ACE2\\nin vivo failed to be infected by SARS-CoV [ 135 , 136 ] On\\nthe other hand, cells with comparatively undetectable\\nlevels of ACE2 (like hepatocytes) were found to be\\ninfected by SARS-CoV [ 137 ]. Likewise, SARS-CoV and\\nMERS-CoV are known to enter the central nervous sys-\\ntem where the ACE2 and DDP430 receptors are very\\nlow [\n```",

Likewise, SARS-CoV and\\nMERS-CoV are known to enter the central nervous sys-\\ntem where the ACE2 and DDP430 receptors are very\\nlow [ 138 ]. Similarly, studies on patients have shown\\nthe presence of SARS-CoV particles in the brain of\\ninfected individuals thus supporting the neuro-invasive\\n– potential of this virus [ 139 141 ]. Since SARS-CoV and\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 are like each other, it is possible that\\nthe latter may also possess such a neuro-invasive\\npotential. Furthermore, in the case of COVID-19, the\\nlatency period may be sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 to\\ninvade the CNS and destroy the medullary neurons\\n[ 138 ]. In support of this theory, some studies\\n[ 4 , 142 , 143 ] have reported that a few of the COVID-19\\npatients did have mild neurologic symptoms like\\nheadaches and nausea, while another recent study\\nreported that an estimated 88% of severe COVID-19\\ncases displayed neurologic manifestations such as\\nacute cerebrovascular disease and impaired conscious-\\nness [ 144 ].\\nThe rapidly mutating virus has also emerged as a\\nmatter of great concern. There is sufficient evidence to\\nstate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is capable of rapidly\\nevolving to invade human immune responses as well as\\ngaining the ability to adapt to other hosts in the near\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 535\\nfuture [ 145 ]. Therefore, close monitoring of the novel\\ncoronavirus is essential to keep the pandemic in check.\\nFinally, the greatest challenge of the current\\nCOVID-19 pandemic is the transmission of the virus to\\nhealthcare workers. Studies report that although strin-\\ngent isolation and quarantine measures are ensured at\\nmedical facilities, yet human-to-human transmission of\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 is highly common [ 146 , 147 ].\\nAccording to recent reports, nearly 41% of the\\npatients were found to be infected in hospital settings,\\nout of which 29% were medical staff [ 148 ]. Such trans-\\nmission in healthcare settings poses a very serious\\nthreat and requires rigorous monitoring.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has unques-\\ntionably raised a major public health emergency all\\nover the world. The threatening concern is attributed\\nto the transmissibility of the virus and its capacity to\\nrapidly evolve and mutate leading to the emergence\\nof new uncommon strains.\\nThe leap in advancement of better diagnosis, tar-\\ngeted vaccines and therapeutic remedies is sound evi-\\ndence that scientific understanding, research, and\\ntechnology is evolving at the pace of the pandemic.\\nEvidently, continued, and consistent research is\\nrequired to improve our knowledge of key aspects of\\nthe viral pathogenesis that can lead to enhanced pre-\\nventive and therapeutic strategies.\\nAcknowledgement\\nWe acknowledge Qatar National Library for supporting the\\npublication of this manuscript.\\nAuthor contributions\\nQF, MM, SM, NT, DM, TB wrote the initial draft and VP pre-\\npared the figures a graphical illustration.

Likewise, SARS-CoV and\\nMERS-CoV are known to enter the central nervous sys-\\ntem where the ACE2 and DDP430 receptors are very\\nlow [ 138 ]. Similarly, studies on patients have shown\\nthe presence of SARS-CoV particles in the brain of\\ninfected individuals thus supporting the neuro-invasive\\n– potential of this virus [ 139 141 ]. Since SARS-CoV and\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 are like each other, it is possible that\\nthe latter may also possess such a neuro-invasive\\npotential. Furthermore, in the case of COVID-19, the\\nlatency period may be sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 to\\ninvade the CNS and destroy the medullary neurons\\n[ 138 ]. In support of this theory, some studies\\n[ 4 , 142 , 143 ] have reported that a few of the COVID-19\\npatients did have mild neurologic symptoms like\\nheadaches and nausea, while another recent study\\nreported that an estimated 88% of severe COVID-19\\ncases displayed neurologic manifestations such as\\nacute cerebrovascular disease and impaired conscious-\\nness [ 144 ].\\nThe rapidly mutating virus has also emerged as a\\nmatter of great concern. There is sufficient evidence to\\nstate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is capable of rapidly\\nevolving to invade human immune responses as well as\\ngaining the ability to adapt to other hosts in the near\\n\\nANNALS OF MEDICINE 535\\nfuture [ 145 ]. Therefore, close monitoring of the novel\\ncoronavirus is essential to keep the pandemic in check.\\nFinally, the greatest challenge of the current\\nCOVID-19 pandemic is the transmission of the virus to\\nhealthcare workers. Studies report that although strin-\\ngent isolation and quarantine measures are ensured at\\nmedical facilities, yet human-to-human transmission of\\nthe SARS-CoV-2 is highly common [ 146 , 147 ].\\nAccording to recent reports, nearly 41% of the\\npatients were found to be infected in hospital settings,\\nout of which 29% were medical staff [ 148 ]. Such trans-\\nmission in healthcare settings poses a very serious\\nthreat and requires rigorous monitoring.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has unques-\\ntionably raised a major public health emergency all\\nover the world. The threatening concern is attributed\\nto the transmissibility of the virus and its capacity to\\nrapidly evolve and mutate leading to the emergence\\nof new uncommon strains.\\nThe leap in advancement of better diagnosis, tar-\\ngeted vaccines and therapeutic remedies is sound evi-\\ndence that scientific understanding, research, and\\ntechnology is evolving at the pace of the pandemic.\\nEvidently, continued, and consistent research is\\nrequired to improve our knowledge of key aspects of\\nthe viral pathogenesis that can lead to enhanced pre-\\nventive and therapeutic strategies.\\nAcknowledgement\\nWe acknowledge Qatar National Library for supporting the\\npublication of this manuscript.\\nAuthor contributions\\nQF, MM, SM, NT, DM, TB wrote the initial draft and VP pre-\\npared the figures a graphical illustration.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index tracks the performance of major technology stocks and experienced a 3.4% decline today.\nentity<|#|>Nexon Technologies<|#|>organization<|#|>Nexon Technologies is a tech company that saw its stock decline by 7.8% after disappointing earnings.\nentity<|#|>Omega Energy<|#|>organization<|#|>Omega Energy is an energy company that gained 2.1% in stock value due to rising oil prices.\nentity<|#|>Gold Futures<|#|>product<|#|>Gold futures rose by 1.5%, indicating increased investor interest in safe-haven assets.\nentity<|#|>Crude Oil<|#|>product<|#|>Crude oil prices rose to $87.60 per barrel due to supply constraints and strong demand.\nentity<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>category<|#|>Market selloff refers to the significant decline in stock values due to investor concerns over interest rates and regulations.\nentity<|#|>Federal Reserve Policy Announcement<|#|>category<|#|>The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy announcement is expected to impact investor confidence and market stability.\nentity<|#|>3.4% Decline<|#|>category<|#|>The Global Tech Index experienced a 3.4% decline in midday trading.\nrelation<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>market performance, investor sentiment<|#|>The decline in the Global Tech Index is part of the broader market selloff driven by investor concerns.\nrelation<|#|>Nexon Technologies<|#|>Global Tech Index<|#|>company impact, index movement<|#|>Nexon Technologies' stock decline contributed to the overall drop in the Global Tech Index.\nrelation<|#|>Gold Futures<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>market reaction, safe-haven investment<|#|>Gold prices rose as investors sought safe-haven assets during the market selloff.\nrelation<|#|>Federal Reserve Policy Announcement<|#|>Market Selloff<|#|>interest rate impact, financial regulation<|#|>Speculation over Federal Reserve policy changes contributed to market volatility and investor selloff.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nAt the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, Noah Carter broke the 100m sprint record using cutting-edge carbon-fiber spikes.\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>event<|#|>The World Athletics Championship is a global sports competition featuring top athletes in track and field.\nentity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the host city of the World Athletics Championship.\nentity<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>person<|#|>Noah Carter is a sprinter who set a new record in the 100m sprint at the World Athletics Championship.\nentity<|#|>100m Sprint Record<|#|>category<|#|>The 100m sprint record is a benchmark in athletics, recently broken by Noah Carter.\nentity<|#|>Carbon-Fiber Spikes<|#|>equipment<|#|>Carbon-fiber spikes are advanced sprinting shoes that provide enhanced speed and traction.\nentity<|#|>World Athletics Federation<|#|>organization<|#|>The World Athletics Federation is the governing body overseeing the World Athletics Championship and record validations.\nrelation<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>event location, international competition<|#|>The World Athletics Championship is being hosted in Tokyo.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>100m Sprint Record<|#|>athlete achievement, record-breaking<|#|>Noah Carter set a new 100m sprint record at the championship.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>Carbon-Fiber Spikes<|#|>athletic equipment, performance boost<|#|>Noah Carter used carbon-fiber spikes to enhance performance during the race.\nrelation<|#|>Noah Carter<|#|>World Athletics Championship<|#|>athlete participation, competition<|#|>Noah Carter is competing at the World Athletics Championship.\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n\n---Real Data to be Processed---\n<Input>\nEntity_types: [Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject]\nText:\n```\nQF, MM, SM, NT, DM, TB wrote the initial draft and VP pre-\\npared the figures a graphical illustration.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.\"\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

    "return": "Remdesivir is an antiviral drug specifically utilized for the treatment of COVID-19, particularly in patients experiencing pneumonia. The drug has been approved by the FDA and is recognized for its effectiveness in managing viral load associated with the disease. It predominantly targets the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby interrupting the viral replication process.\n\nResearch on Remdesivir has evaluated its efficacy against various emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, known as variants of concern (VOCs). While the drug is noted for its ability to target a broad range of viruses, it has been reported to encounter resistance issues with some VOCs. Despite this, studies indicate that Remdesivir shows minimal pre-existing resistance among circulating virus variants, suggesting its ongoing relevance in the treatment landscape.\n\nIn some treatment protocols, Remdesivir is used in combination with other medications, such as Baricitinib, to enhance therapeutic outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19. Overall, Remdesivir remains a critical component in managing COVID-19, particularly for patients presenting with pneumonia and requiring urgent antiviral intervention.",

As a novel strain of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been the central focus of extensive research and review, especially concerning diagnostics, variants, and vaccine development. The virus is characterized as an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus.\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the identification of various variants that influence the effectiveness of diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches. These variants pose challenges as they may exhibit mutations, particularly in the spike protein, which is crucial for vaccine development. Such mutations raise concerns regarding the virus's ability to evade antibodies and impact treatment efficacy.\n\nDetection of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily conducted using nucleic acid-based methods, with several diagnostic assays specifically developed to identify antibodies against its antigens. Multiple vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, including NVX-CoV2373, AZD1222, Gam-COVID-Vac, and BBIBP-CorV, which aim to provide immunity and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Vaccines like ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Sinovac's inactivated viral vaccine have also been highlighted in studies.\n\nResearch on SARS-CoV-2 extends to its potential neuro-invasive properties, which, combined with its rapid mutation rates, underline the ongoing challenges faced in managing the virus.
