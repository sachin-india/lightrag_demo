## üéõÔ∏è Tuning Answer Conciseness

Edit the configuration section at the top of `query_lightrag.py`:

### For CONCISE Answers (1-2 sentences):
```python
CHUNK_TOP_K = 3             # Fewer chunks = less context
MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 75  # Short output limit
CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = True # Force brief responses  
QUERY_MODE = "naive"        # Best for direct retrieval
ENABLE_LATENCY_TRACKING = True  # Monitor performance
```

### For DETAILED Answers (comprehensive):
```python
CHUNK_TOP_K = 20            # More chunks = rich context
MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 3000 # Long output limit
CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = False # Natural length responses
QUERY_MODE = "global"       # Best for comprehensive analysis
ENABLE_LATENCY_TRACKING = True  # Monitor performance
```

### Current MODERATE Settings (balanced):
```python
CHUNK_TOP_K = 12           # Balanced context
MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 250 # Medium length answers
CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = True # Concise responses
QUERY_MODE = "hybrid"      # Balanced retrieval
ENABLE_LATENCY_TRACKING = True  # Monitor performance
```

## üìä Parameter Guide

| Parameter | Concise | Moderate | Detailed | Description |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | 50-100 | 300-800 | 2000-4000 | Output length limit |
| `CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | True | False | False | Force brief answers |
| `QUERY_MODE` | "naive" | "naive" | "global" | Search strategy |
| `TOP_K` | 10 | 15 | 40 | Entities/relations |

## üîç Query Modes

- **`naive`** - Pure vector search on text chunks (best for specific facts)
- **`local`** - Entity-focused search (good for relationships) 
- **`global`** - Comprehensive analysis (best for broad topics)
- **`hybrid`** - Combines local + global (balanced approach)

## üí° Tips

1. **Start with current settings** - they work well for most cases
2. **For very short answers** - Set `CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = True`
3. **For rich detail** - Increase `CHUNK_TOP_K` and `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`
4. **If answers seem incomplete** - Try "global" mode
5. **If answers are too verbose** - Reduce `CHUNK_TOP_K` and token limits

## üîß Advanced Settings

```python
MAX_ENTITY_TOKENS = 2000   # Context from entities
MAX_RELATION_TOKENS = 2000 # Context from relations  
MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS = 6000    # Total context limit
```

Lower these values for faster, more focused responses.

## üìù Example Usage

1. Edit your questions in `queries.txt`:
```
What are the main COVID-19 symptoms?
How effective are mRNA vaccines?
Who wrote the paper on emerging variants?
```

2. Configure conciseness in `query_lightrag.py`

3. Run: `python query_lightrag.py`

4. Check results in `answers.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- lightrag-hku package
- openai package  
- Existing LightRAG storage in `rag_storage/`

## üìû Configuration Examples

**Ultra Concise (Twitter-style)**:
```python
CHUNK_TOP_K = 3
MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 50
CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = True
```

**Academic Detail**:
```python  
CHUNK_TOP_K = 20
MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS = 4000
CONCISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = False
QUERY_MODE = "global"
```

## üß† Understanding LightRAG Query Modes

### How Each Mode Works (Simplified)

#### üîµ **Hybrid Mode** (Recommended Default)
**How it works:** Combines local entity search + global summarization in parallel, then merges results.

**Think of it as:** A smart librarian who quickly checks both the index cards (entities) AND skims through relevant chapters (text chunks), then gives you the best of both.

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- Fastest performance (leverages parallel processing)
- Balanced context from both entities and text
- Best for most real-world applications
- Consistently fast (1-2s typical)

**‚ùå Disadvantages:**
- May occasionally miss very obscure details
- Not as comprehensive as pure global mode

**Best for:** Production apps, chatbots, quick Q&A systems

---

#### üü¢ **Naive Mode**
**How it works:** Pure vector similarity search on text chunks. No entity/relation graphs involved.

**Think of it as:** A search engine that finds the most relevant text passages and reads them directly.

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- Simple and straightforward
- Good for specific fact-finding
- No graph traversal overhead
- Predictable behavior

**‚ùå Disadvantages:**
- Slower than hybrid (no parallel processing)
- Misses entity relationships
- Less contextual understanding
- Can't connect dots across documents

**Best for:** Simple fact lookup, when you know the answer is in specific text passages

---

#### üü° **Local Mode**
**How it works:** Focuses on knowledge graph entities and their relationships. Searches for relevant entities first, then reads connected information.

**Think of it as:** A detective who follows the web of connections between people, places, and concepts.

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- Best for relationship questions ("Who works with whom?")
- Most detailed entity-focused answers
- Excellent at connecting related concepts
- Great for exploring knowledge graphs

**‚ùå Disadvantages:**
- Slower (needs to traverse entity graph)
- Can be overly detailed
- May miss context from plain text
- Not ideal for simple factual questions

**Best for:** Research, exploring relationships, understanding connections between entities

---

#### üî¥ **Global Mode**
**How it works:** Analyzes the entire knowledge base, creates high-level summaries, then answers from that broad understanding.

**Think of it as:** A professor who has read everything and gives you the big picture view.

**‚úÖ Benefits:**
- Most comprehensive understanding
- Best for broad "explain X" questions
- Captures overarching themes
- Good for summarization tasks

**‚ùå Disadvantages:**
- Slowest mode (analyzes entire corpus)
- Can be verbose
- May include less relevant context
- Overkill for simple questions

**Best for:** Research reports, comprehensive analysis, "explain the overall concept" questions
